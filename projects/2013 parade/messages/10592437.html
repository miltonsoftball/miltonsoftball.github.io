    Hi Everyone,<br>Rain is forecasted for Friday PM and Saturday AM - but we all know how weather changes and it could be nice and clear for Sat.   I have a parade update and list of volunteers.  See below for plan A, Plan B, and Plan C for day of:<br><br>Set up at 10am - Jen, Kevin, Laurie J, Ted to get ice<br>(3) people to help sell pizza, water, magnets - ??  Let me know if you would like to SELL<br>(5-6) people handing out popsicles - great opportunity for older kids - <br>(3) people to plate pizza - Paul Tegan, Jen Tegan, ??<br>(4) or more to help clean-up - Tegan family, Shawn<br><br><b>Who is bringing what?  Please let me know if you will not be able to bring your item(s)</b>.  <br>Gary - tent<br>Kevin - table, sound system, banners<br>Karen - signs<br>Ken - pizza, water<br>Me - magnets, paper products, popsicles, change for bank, extra trash bags, camera, zip ties<br>rich - cooler<br>Laurie - table, cooler<br>Bill - table, cooler<br>trophies ??<br>Did I forget anything?<br><br>Plan A:  Good weather, everything goes off as planned, food and parade<br>Plan B: rain contingent - we have parade, but no food (decision is made to cancel food on Friday)<br>Plan C: Extreme rain - cancel parade all together - we had to do this two years ago on Saturday morning.<br><br>Unfortunately I have not heard back from Tim Allen on throwing out the first pitch, hope to today, we might need to improvise.  I hadn't called Chief Wells - because I know the Milton Police have been very busy with the stabbing that took place on Sunday night and I am sure the many that have been effected by the marathon tragedy.  Open to suggestions?<br><br>After yesterday, I don't know about you but I am looking forward to some sunny skies, girls walking in their uniforms and smiling faces.  Thank you all for your help!<br>Best, Jen

          The pizza has been ordered through Pat's. I ordered 33 cheese. I just need to finalize a delivery time. I have picked up all of the waters for Saturday. Also I know my daughter Caroline is up for volunteering for community service hours I do not know if other high school student might want to help???

          Bill, she has to check in with Kevin and he will sign off on with her total hours that she volunteered on a sheet she needs to get at the guidance office next week when she goes back to school. She should make copies of the sheet to have as she does community service to be filled in.
