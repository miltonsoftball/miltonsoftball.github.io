          Hi Jen, As of right now I have to work Saturday, although I may be able to get it off. If I cannot, I can drop off my table and cooler to someone to bring. I will keep you posted when I find out about getting the day off.

          I am planning on the pizzas to be delivered just before 12noon. I will contact Pat today to see if we can borrow a couple of the delivery bags to keep them hot. I will help with the plating as well. The waters I have in my garage for Saturday. My daughter Caroline is planning on helping out for those community service hours.

          Jen, I can no longer stick around for clean-up.  We are going to a nieces first communion in Hanover, and I will probably have to cut out around 1:30... happy to help out with set-up in any way if possible (note that I have a 9am game first)

          Pauline was asking if we used her PA equipment last year, or Kevins?  She may want to bring her own, would that be okay?
