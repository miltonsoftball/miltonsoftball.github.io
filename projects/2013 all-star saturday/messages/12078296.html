          My feedback: <br><br>positives:<br>- Overall day was fantastic  <br>- I talked to alot of parents/kids at the Freshman Skills -- they loved it: especially getting soaked under the hose <br>- sophomore game was a big hit -- kids (and their parents) loved being announced on the PA system<br>- I was in and out at juniors game, and not at the senior game (so no specific feedback their)<br>- coordination and volunteer effort was very strong - everyone came together and it never felt like a big scramble<br><br>negatives:<br>- whoever was responsible for the weather dropped the ball (much too hot)<br>- seemed like it wasn't well attended by non-all stars (weather could have played a role there) -- might want to consider creative ways to get others to attend<br>- the food/ bake sale didnt seem well positioned to attract alot of families that did attend <br><br>overall - -was a very successful day - and all I spoke to had a great time

          The few people that I spoke to had a good time, nothing negative to report. <br><br>It did seem under attended for the Junior game, I was not there for the Freshwomen challenge or Sophomore game, I agree with Shawn that could have been due to the heat. There was probably people watching from their cars, with the A/C blasting!<br><br>The senior game had a good amount of people at it! <br><br>I was impressed with all the baked good that were donated, great job to Kate! Thanks for organizing and running!

          I thought it was well executed. I agree that being such a hot day didn't help any. I also agree with Shawn that maybe coming up with some fun activities or contests for non All Stars is worth exploring. There's not a lot to draw the kids who didn't make the team to come down and watch.

          Random thought, but if a simple hose made the kids happy and chances are its warm again, what if we tried some sort of "MGS  Softball Water Olympics".  If feasable, we could have a few contests through sprinklers and different stations extending down right field, inviting the whole league to participate. Maybe Slip and Slide for sliding, etc. Maybe for 1/2 hour between each of the games to attract kids all day?
