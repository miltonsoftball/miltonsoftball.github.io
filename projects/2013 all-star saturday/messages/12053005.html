    Hi All,<br>Great job by everyone for All-Star Saturday!  I wasn't able to be around as much this year and I really appreciate how everyone pulled together to put on another fantastic event for our Milton Softball league.  I think a big round of applause for all, but a special shout out to Kevin and Karen for all the additional work they put in organizing and communicating to keep us all on the same page.  Congrats to all the winning coaches and teams.<br><br>On another note - I have a few receipts (which I am sure I am not the only one) and will get to Bill this week!<br><br>Best,<br>Jen<br>FYI - i think i have identified who the lacrosse bag belongs to in the box at Gile.  I will borrow a key and retrieve ASAP.
