    <h2>Volunteer Schedule and Things We Need</h1>
    <p>Posted by Kevin Olivieri on May 27, 2013</p>

  <div class="content">
    Hi Board Members, <br><br>I hope you had a good long weekend.  Today was definitely the prize of the weekend.<br><br>As you know<b> All-Star Saturday is this Saturday, June 1st</b>.  The extended weather forecast looks good.  Hopefully it wil stay that way.  We have three big "events" on Saturday:<br><br><ul>
<li>Freshwomen Skills Challenge</li>
<li>Sophomore, Junior and Senior All-Star Games</li>
<li>Cookout</li>
</ul><br>I have attached a document that will serve as the master volunteer schedule.  The second tab on the document is a working list of everything we need for the event.  The list will continue to grow I'm sure.  Kate Carroll is coordinating a bake sale that will align well with our cookout. <b><i> As we discussed at the board meeting, all proceeds from the bake sale and the cookout will go to the One Fund.</i></b><br><br>Please take a look at each tab (schedule and items we need) and let us know how you can help us make this Saturday a memorable event.  We can use as much time as you can sacrifice.  As Board Members, it is important we have a strong presence at the event in addition to encouraging others to volunteer their time.<br><br>A few of the big areas of need include making water balloons (we need about 130) and as well as someone who can help prep the fields before each game.  We have a new chalk liner we can use.  Plus we have many other needs.<br><br>Please review the document and reply to this thread with when you are available (and for what) and what you can bring.<br><br>We will continue to update the document throughout the week here on Basecamp.<br><br>Thank you for all your help.

          Just a thought, but it looks to be sunny and almost 90 degrees on Saturday. What if  we attach a portable sprinkler to the hose at Gile and let the kids run through it in the outfield to stay cool during or after  Freshman challenge and maybe even later for sophomores?

          I am planning on getting the waters to Gile and picking up the food at Pat's. If it is going to be a hot day we will need several coolers and ice to keep the burgers, hot dogs and waters cold. I will not be available for a majority of the day as my daughter is graduating the following day from the high school and I have do a lot of running around  for her party the next day. Sorry but the timing is not the best.

          Hi Karen, I can help where ever needed during the Junior game, and should be back at Gile around 3:30. So you can add me to empty time slots, or I can just go where need that day. <br><br>Have there been any volunteers through the emails that went out from the league? (We will need more helpers than just the board members and their family members)<br>If there hasn't been any responses, maybe another email needs to go out later today or tomorrow, asking for volunteers, an hour or two, before or after, their child's game/event.

          Great idea.  We just need to make sure the hose is far enough away from the field of play that it doesn't get to wet for the games following (although the sun may take care of that).<br><br>Is it a normal hose?  For some reason I thought it was larger.

          Hose connection is a different size, that had to be special ordered.  I am not familiar if there would be any type of converter, I dont think so.<br><br>It could still act as a fun tool to cool kids off and have fun. <br><br>The actually connection is technically in foul territory past first base by about 20 feet, going out towards right field, about 10 feet off the chalk line.  It would be fine to use out in the right field area, until the Jr game if not the Sr game, as not much offensive activity will be going out that far during games, except maybe Seniors.<br><br><br>You may want to consider using this for some of the Freshman fun!

          Kenny, great job getting the Line Marking machine.<br><br>I asked the director of Park and Rec, as a favor, to line the fields on Saturday (at no extra charge to us).  He was able to get a worker to come in, at his cost for this Saturday, to line the field sometime in the morning, for we at least have one fresh set of lines, that will hopefully be a good guide for us to use, as we put the new machine to work.<br><br>He is trying to have the worker come in near 1:30 before the first all-star game, but he is not sure if he can control what time, Saturday morning, he will be prepping the field.<br><br>I received a text this evening that Home Plate is an issue at Gile, and that will be reported AGAIN to the Park and Rec dept.  I am confident they will be checking on it tomorrow.

          Karen, I will have water balloons and cooler at field by 11.  Glad I am helping with the freshman skills contest -- if you need more volunteer work -- sign me up for anything after freshman skills -- through the junior all star game.

          As Gary mentioned, I verified hose at Gile is larger width  than typical garden hose, so don't think my sprinkler will work there.
