    I spoke with Gary Wednesday and Mike today. I told them we would like a single updated plan with suggested improvements by next BOD meeting.  I told them our concerns were 1. No input from parents. 2. Too much standing around, at least when understaffed. 3. Defined pay and consistency with staffing. They will discuss and make a plan.

          Should we ask Mike Kinsella to next meeting to discuss K or even see if he's interested in rejoining board since he's part of the program still? Would probably be better to have both there if we want to discuss.
