To date we have 70 responses. I have not looked at the data and probably won't until the survey is closed.<br><br><b>K Program Survey</b><br>Survey sent out earlier in the week and a reminder was sent on 6/24. To date we have 8 responses.Â <br><br><b>Player Evaluations </b><br>Evaluation surveys went out to the head coaches for the 4th graders, 6th graders and 7th graders on 6/24. 4th grade data helps inform 2017 Junior teams and 6th and 7th will help with the 2017 Senior Division.<br><br>Have a great weekend.<br><br>Kevin
