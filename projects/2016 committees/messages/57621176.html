    <p>As members of the board, we would like you to consider a major investment
for the Milton Girls Softball Program – a scoreboard for the Gile Road Field.
The recommendation is for Milton Girls Softball to secure ownership of a
Daktronics scoreboard to provide key in-game information.</p><p><br></p><p>Kudos to Gary for having a passion to get this to where it is today - lots of conversations, working with town run departments, and lots of leg work. Thank you Gary.</p><p><br></p><p>Bill, Brian and I have been talking to Gary over the past few days. These conversations as well as information from Gary, the scoreboard vendor and outside research have
been compiled into the attached document. </p><p><br></p><p><b>What We Ask of You</b></p><p>Between now and Monday's Board Meeting, please read the attached. We hope this document informs you with enough information to offer your recommendation. Use Basecamp and ask questions. Post your thoughts. <b>This is an important decision and we want your input. </b></p><p><br></p><p>During Monday's Board Meeting we will designate a finite amount of time to discuss. We will not be reviewing the document but rather soliciting your feedback and POV. Bill, Brian and I will regroup within a day or two of the board meeting to make a decision.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you.</p>

          Hello all,<br><br>It's been three weeks since our board meeting and more importantly our discussion regarding the scoreboard.<br><br>In the days following the board meeting, Bill, Brian and I continued to receive feedback and thoughts from all of you. <br><br>We followed with a discussion between the three of us regarding next steps. I then reached out to Gary (who I discovered was at his daughter's graduation from Bucknell- congrats Michaela!) and we agreed to connect upon his return. I connected with Gary last week and I shared with him our thoughts and next steps.<br><br>Here is a summary of where we are going:<br><br><div>We absolutely want to do a scoreboard. At this point in time, there is no benefit in rushing it.</div><div>- delivery is 4-8 weeks</div><div>- installation will be additional time</div><div>- ready for use late July/Early August (end of summer travel)</div><div><br></div><div>The scoreboard will not have an impact in 2016.</div><div><br></div><div>We want to do it right.</div><div><br></div><div>Scoreboard is part of the equation as we define the future of Milton Girls Softball for the next decade.<br><br>What else is part of that equation? Field swap? Another practice diamond at Gile? Lighting issues resolved? Stands built in the hill along the first base line?<br><br>To determine this, we want to take a step back. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Next steps:</b></div><div>Conduct a feasibility study:</div><div>- Determine who to talk to and in what order about even exploring a field swap<br>- Evaluate possibility of a field swap with baseball at Gile (and Kelly)</div><div>- Determine what is required to fix the light situation at Gile</div><div>- Determine costs to run electrical outlets to Gile backstop</div><div>- Understand approval/costs to cut an infield at Gile (deep right field)</div><div>- Study the placement of the scoreboard (sunset, optimal viewing, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>Nick has volunteered to take the lead with the feasibility study along with the support of others. The study will be completed by the end of Q3 (September 2016).<br><br>The rationale behind doing a feasibility study is to see what is possible. If the feasibility study comes back with a strong possibility of doing a field swap, it will help us define our capital plan and outline our roadmap for the future of Milton Girls Softball. If it does not, it will not prevent us from moving forward with a scoreboard.<br><br>We understand that there is always a risk of getting caught up in Milton Politics, red tape, etc. We also do not want to become paralyzed by indecision. We won't let this happen. By focusing on this during our off-season (and not during spring season, summer tryouts, All-star planning, etc.), we will give it the attention it deserves.<br><br>Let's keep the idea of even thinking of a field swap quiet (within the Board). It's a sensitive issue and with Gary and Nick's help, I think we can determine how to navigate these waters. We want to avoid a Boston Olympics 2024-type reaction by not involving the right people at the right time.<br><br>This is an exciting time for Milton Girls Softball.<br><br>Please feel free to reach out with any questions/thoughts.<br><br>Kevin</div>
