          This is a list of who we have helping when...food prep starts at 3:30 and<br>fields need to be prepped for each game (lined, rosters, direct players,<br>t-shirts). Please be flexible and go where help is needed. Games starting<br>and ending on time is the priority. If parents volunteer to help please<br>utilize them.<br><br>We do need an MC for Soph, Jr and Sr game- players are great as long as<br>they are self sufficient or you can sit with them. If anyone has good music<br>on an ipod we can use for the day we are in desperate need.<br><br>For supplies we could use one more tent and one more table.

          Thanks everyone for spending your Saturday between coaching games and helping out at the Skills Challenge, selling food and working at the all-star games. Girls from K through 8th grade had a great time. The weather sealed the deal.<br><br>The help of all of you made it a great success. We should have a summary of how we did as soon as we get expenses from a handful of us. Stay tuned.<br><br>More importantly, I would like to recognize our <b>3 Stars of the Day</b> (taking a page out of hockey's playbook). <br><br><b>Star #1 - Dana Rundlett</b><br>Dana was determined to address the issue with the hose at Gile. He fixed it but he also had an accident. He cut himself badly and had to go to the ER. 100 stitches and some work by a hand specialist, he is recovering and even made an appearance at Senior Game. Get well soon Dana!<br><br><b>Star #2 - Calece Johnson</b><br>Calece took the All-Star Day by the horns and rallied all of us. She planned out the day, made assignments and got us organized. She also had a great idea when she woke up at 5AM and it paid off. She created a 50/50 raffle and it was an incredible success. It took in over $600 with over $300 going to MGS. Thank you Calece!!<br><br><b>Star #3 - Gio<br></b>Gio. What can I say? Bill planned the Skills Challenge and had the girls leaving with popsicles, t-shirts and smiles. He did a great job with the event. After running off to his game, he came back and cooked up hot dogs and pull pork sandwiches. Thanks to Bill and Marinanne for dedicating their Saturday to Milton Girls Softball. Much appreciated.<br><br>Thanks again to everyone for making it a great day!<b> Please send any receipts/expenses to Calece as soon as you can.</b><br><br>Thanks everyone!
