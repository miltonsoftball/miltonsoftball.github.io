    <b>JUNE 4th - K/FRESHMAN SKILLS CHALLENGE (All Star Saturday)<br></b><br>John C.,  Lloyde and Shawna signed up for this.  Shawna has to be out of town actually, but I know several others have already mentioned they planned to attend as well.  I will send out a slightly revised schedule of the skill contests and itinerary soon.   <br><br>The kids event is 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. All volunteers asked to be there beginning at 12:30 PM.   <br><br><b>Anyone who intends to be on hand for all or part of this please give me a heads up at your earliest convenience.  </b>  Almost all help needed will really just be day of assistance making sure each station goes smoothly.   <br><br>However, I will need help manufacturing the beloved water balloons!    <b>Maybe a handful of folks want to commit to bringing down about 20 each?</b>    If you can please let me know.  <br><br>Thanks!  <br><br>Bill Gio.<b><br></b>

          Folks, with All Star day a week from today, we are concerned that the planning is lacking. Specifically, we need someone to take charge and "own" the event. It should be somebody who signed up for the day. This includes the skills challenge (well covered by Bill Gio), field prep, and cookout. In past years a spreadsheet with time slot sign ups  has been posted here. A suggestion would be to scale down the menu and timeframe for cookout. This is one of our 3 major events of the year and we hope that the board steps up as we always have. Thanks.
