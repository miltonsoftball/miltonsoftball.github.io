    Couple of updates regarding Opening Day and the Parade:<br><ul>
<li>Email sent to the Milton Times last Friday, April 15th regarding our Opening Day Festivities. They acknowledged the email so hopefully it will make it into the paper. At the time we did not have a sponsor (Thank you Nick for securing Towne Tree &amp; Landscaping as a team sponsor AND the event sponsor!!). I emailed the Milton Times with this additional information but have not heard back. Hopefully they will make the minor update to the information I provided</li>
<li>Emailed the program (790 emails) regarding opening day/parade (4/19)</li>
<li>Posted information about the parade on the home page (4/19)</li>
</ul><br>Thanks!<br>Kevin

          I can be at the field before the parade for set up just let me know what time. I also have tent and cooler if need them.  I will also be available to help after parade. I think my assistant coaches are both away.

          With Towne Tree &amp; Landscaping as our event sponsor, we ordered large vinyl banners that we will hang side by side on the fence along Edge Hill Road facing out to the street. Here is a preview of what they will look like:

          The Milton Times published our submission. They didn't include the event sponsor but I'm glad we got some ink.
