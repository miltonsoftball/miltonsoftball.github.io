           Any goals for this piece I should know about other than similar or additional to what the league has done on it before, please just pass those along and we'll do our best!

          Hi Gio, <br>I will be away in Michigan chaperoning a school trip during All-Star weekend so I cannot help you out with the Freshman challenge the day of.  Is there anything I can do before hand to help prepare?

          Calese,<br><br>Thanks for asking.  I think I'll be alright and have no worries at least :)<br><br>We seem to have plenty of help.   Kevin sent me what he had, and unless you<br>have anything else of your own I think that should be enough.   If you do<br>remember any glitches you remember I wouldn't be thinking off just flip<br>those and I'll figure it out.<br><br>Thanks.<br>-Gio
