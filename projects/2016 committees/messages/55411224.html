    <h2>2016 Scholarship Committee</h1>
    <p>Posted by Calece Johnson on March  9, 2016</p>

  <div class="content">
    Starting a discussion for the 2016 Scholarship. To be in the MHS cycle, I'd like to move up the deadline for applicants to Friday, April 8th. Then to meet MHS deadline we need to decide by April 15th so we'd meet that week to make a decision. <br><br>The other schools need to be contacted quickly if this is our decision. Can we run an ad in the Times Kevin?<br><br>It doesn't matter to me if we do application electronic or by paper (which is sent to PO Box).

          We are less than a month from the April 8th application due date. Do we have the information I can post on the website? <br><br>We can also ask Lloyd to push it on social media. <br><br>We can talk about an ad in the times but is it to reach the high school girls or more from publicity? We may be able to get it in as content/article vs. running an ad.

          I think we can push the deadline a few days to give more time. I'm double checking with MHS. Their deadline is April 15th for names. We need to have our dates in place to be sure we know when we're supposed to review everything (ie copies made, us able to meet which is over April break which will be a bit tough but doable by phone I assume). <br><br>I'm fine with no ads in the Times. The counselors at high schools will probably hand it out to all of their existing senior players. Social media will be good. <br><br>I'm adding Shawna to the string since she volunteered to receive the applications via email. What address do you want us to use on the communications Shawna? <br><br>Shawn or Brian can you reach out to the other schools? Find guidance department on website and send them the application (think we'll be fine on their deadlines but if you can check soon that would be great)<br><p>Fontbonne</p><p>Ursuline</p><p>Notre Dame</p><p>Milton Academy</p><p>Thayer</p><p><br></p><p>Kevin, please confirm names of scholarships. Should we check really quick with the families to be sure they're ok with us using their loved ones names?</p><p>MGS Scholarship 2016</p><p><i>in memoriam of 'a' and 'b'</i></p>

          I updated the website to reflect the new application/dates. Here is the link for review:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=79408&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=79408&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br><br>Also, based on Ted's idea I took the application and created a Google Form. If the committee prefers, we can provide a link to the following online application. Information would be stored in a database that is only accessible by Shawna. This is only a suggestion and I will follow the lead of the committee.  <br><br>Here is a link to the online application for review/feedback:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://goo.gl/forms/tZWRIr7cQA" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/forms/tZWRIr7cQA</a>

          As I think about having the scholarships "in memory of" it's important to point out that both Denise and Smokey have girls who are seniors this year. Would it be awkward if there are scholarships that are in memory of their respective parent but they do not win/get awarded them?<br><br>Just tossing this out there...

          Oh gosh, yes, I do think that would be awkward. Possibly do scholarship<br>name for them next year and do something else this year to honor them?<br>Opening day or championship day?

          Thank you Scholarship Committee for reviewing the applications and selecting two winners. Both winners are meet the requirements and are approved.<br><br>Feel free to let the respective schools know of the award and Calece can coordinate getting checks to the school.<br><br>Also, not sure if there is an opportunity to present the award, but if there is we would love for a committee member to present the award. I am happy to help as well. <br><br>I love that we offer this to "graduates" of our program. Thanks for making it happen.

          The schools have been notified about the awardees. Is someone good at<br>making certificates? And can we grab a couple shirts to give them?<br><br>MHS- Their awards night is May 31st. I am happy to be present to make the<br>award but if anyone else wants to do it just let me know so I can<br>coordinate with the guidance counselor.<br><br>Fontbonne - They do not have an awards night. I have notified the guidance<br>counselor who will put it in their graduation brochure. So we need to<br>notify the winner but probably not until closer to MHS date. Then I was<br>thinking seeing if she can come to All Star game to officially hand her<br>check. We can also invite MHS awardee but they won't find out about it<br>until May 31st.
