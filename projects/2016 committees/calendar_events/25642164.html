          Hi everyone. Looking to get a roster of who is able to help at the event and for how long. Parade is scheduled for 11:45am and games/entertInment will run until 2:30. We could use at least 20 people in all, including folks to help with both food and entertainment. Coaches, parents, spouses are welcome. Also, older girls who have been in the program and are looking for community service hours are also welcome. Please respond by Thursday at latest so we have an idea on numbers. Will also need at least 3 Parade Marshall coaches to organize the girls at 11:30 at corner of Huntington. We eliminated a bouncy inflatable and added a couple field games for more team interaction. Thanks

          I will take a later shift since I don't have a game, staying till the end<br>to help with clean up, etc. I can bring a table and 3 folding chairs if we<br>need them- I'll bring them and cash by 11:15ish. I can be a parade marshal<br>(I have lots of assistants that can walk with my players:)).<br><br>Bill, let me know how much cash you think we need for change, etc. If the<br>play house people take credit card that would be ideal, otherwise I can<br>write them a check that day.

          Calece, I'm just guessing but I would have at least 250  in singles, maybe more. and some 5's. For everyone volunteering tables, please bring them. At least a couple tents and I'll bring sides as wind might pick up in afternoon. Thanks.

          Hi All...my apologies for not being around this weekend to help with the Parade. I had a last minute opportunity to head down to see my daughter one last weekend before she graduates from college.   It is exciting to see the Parade growing into a great kickoff event for the league.   It was not many years ago (pre any bod), that a enthuastic mom approached me in a store, and said "Why don't we have a parsde, let's do a parade ". The next year was our first parade (hats off to our prior board member Jen Tegan for planting the seed). <br><br>Hope you have great weather, best of luck with the day.

It was a complete group effort.<br><br>I think this text I received is indicative of the day had by many:<br><br><i>"Hi! We had a great day! She had such a great time at practice, the parade and we stayed for hours at the party. I am so impressed with the program coaches and older players.Thank you so much for responding and getting us in on such short notice. She had such a great day and we are looking forward to the season. Thanks again!"<br></i><br>Photos have been posted on the website and Facebook (thanks Calece!).<br><br>Thanks again for all your help. I am very proud to be part of Milton Girls Softball.

          Visionary, Bill! Seriously a Fantastic idea that was executed perfectly- the MA little league dad told me "we're getting shown up by the softball program" :)<br>Kids had a blast. 25 sixth graders hung around till 230.

          I'd like to give a shout out and thanks to everybody who helped make yesterday a success. Starting with Kevin, who was down at a wet field at 8am putting up banners, stayed throughout,  and I'm assuming took them down late in the day. Thanks to all of the board members who attended and most of whom stayed throughout. Everybody who lugged down tables, coolers ect. Brian and Brian for running a couple errands during the event. A special thanks to Bill Gio "The Hot Dog King of Milton" who was tireless and outstanding all day. Calece and Lloyd, who took on probably the least attractive job of organizing or monitoring the girls at the games for a long period of time. Bob McCarthy, my great friend and I'm pretty sure the longest tenured current coach in the program, for both oreganizing girls for parade with Calece, and then monitoring the obstacle course for a long stint. Also in no particular order for helping out: Marianne Giovanucci, Mike Kinsella (after running K program at 9), Laureen and Ashley Vaughn, Jenna Conroy, Bella Calcagno, Mary Lou Rundlett, Keith Schleicher, Pauline and Richard Wells, and Dave Wahlgren. Apologies if I missed somebody, and again all efforts were much appreciated.  I also  thought Stacey Smith from Pick A Party Place and her staff did a good job with the event and deserve consideration as a potential partner in the future.
