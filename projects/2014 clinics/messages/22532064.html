          Hopefully tonights Open House Clinic goes great, things are looking good, as Coach Losi and the HS girls team will have some players there to help and catch for those who do not have a catcher.  We have 2 Professional Instructors along with the help of the HS girls Varsity Pitchers.<br><br>Looks like we will have good board representation, as Bill, Brian, Rich, Sean and myself will be present.  If Bill and Brian could bring a bucket of softballs, and Sean if you have the softies still from your division we could use those as well.<br><br>So far the cost for this has been negligible, Bill if you could bring a check with you in case we need it for anything, we may want to give a small stipend (tip)to the Professional Instructors as a token of thanks.<br><br>We are having the follow up Pitching Clinics after this at Quincy Armory, starting 3/19 for 5 weeks, I wonder if we bring a flyer that we can hand out.

          Looks good. Do the girls have to bring a catcher? Know this was part of it<br>in the past- which I wasn't clear on. Can the catcher be an adult? When do<br>they have to sign up by? And will registration be closed once it's filled<br>which might be closer than the deadline?

          Good feedback.  Document updated with Catcher requirement - could be an adult or a player.<br><br>Sign up until 3/19 or when slots are filled. Registration will close when we fill the slots.

          The Pitching Clinic Registration is live on the website under Registration.<br><br>I will hold off promoting it via email and the home page until AFTER the clinic tonight so we give the girls tonight first dibs.  <br><br>I also do not want to promote it on the website until after the open house tonight as to avoid any confusion between the two clinics/events.

          Thanks to all the board members and coaches in helping make the Clinic a success last night.<br><br>The turnout was good, we had 22 girls register at the door, expectations were for at least 40,  but for the size of the group, it worked out great.  I expected more with Eddie Baker sneaking it in his article at the last minute for me. Considering I locked down the facility late, and we went out with a notice late, overall it was fine, especially where our total cost was $20 !!  Last nights venue would have either costed the attendees, or the program a total expense of over $500.<br><br>We introduced everyone, then had the Coach Losi and the HS Varsity girls teach them how to warm up and throw.  Then Janelle took over, and did a great job.  Parents on the way out went out of their way to thank us and say how much they liked it.<br><br>A number of things we learned, if we did have a group of 40- 60 , we would need enough instructors to break off into groups of 12-16 kids, so 4 to 5 instructors, which is doable as the basic instruction is the same, (grip, snaps, butterly, clock, around the world, this all takes about an hour).  <br><br>The group was mostly 3rd and 4th graders, this was the most rewarding part of the clinic, as we want to target the younger girls.<br><br>Bill and I will do a full recap for we can build on this.  The takeaway for me is to find space for kids to either find a reason to learn, or a reason to practice, if we have the venues, more kids will either try to learn, or keep the ones trying, practicing.

          I agree with Gary and want to thank him for  putting it together,  as he did all the leg work for this event. I agree that getting a majority of younger girls to attend was the most rewarding aspect of it. I feel that these types of clinics that introduce and reinforce mechanics to current and future pitchers are a great building block for the program, as well as the high school down the line. Thanks to Coach Losi and the high school players  who helped out as well.
