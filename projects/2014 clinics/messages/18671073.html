          We've finalized the initial phase of clinics  for the coming season. Dirt Dawgs will be our partner for all around skill clinics. 8 weekly sessions on Sunday nights starting January 26 until March 23rd, skipping Super Bowl Sunday.   There will be 2 sessions,from 5-8pm grades 3-5, and 6-8. Each will be 90 minutes. Cost will be $10 per girl per session (paid by MGS) Estimated 40-50 will sign up total, with estimated cost about 4k. Still to be finalized are two free pitching clinics at a indoor Milton location TBD, which will serve to narrow interested pitching candidates to an additional series of clinics that the families will pay for. Finally, we propose team and coaches clinics to be held possibly at TJO's, once the teams have been determined. Estimated cost for these are about $2k.

          Hello all...........a belated Happy New Year!!!  <br><br>Within the last 24 hours I have communicated to Kevin that I have formally resigned from the Board of Directors of Milton Girls Softball. I don't mean to leave you all in the lurch. For personal reasons,  I feel that I cannot give the full effort that it takes to perform the task of reaching out to the community for their financial support for our softball league. Almost 4 years ago when Gary and Kevin asked me to become a member of the board and I assumed the roll of Director of Sponsorships I never would have imagined that I would have been able to raise just under $30,000.00 for the softball league. It has been a passion of mine to always do better year after year. Sometimes it was a challenge to track down the business owner to get to commit. Then the follow-up for the check and artwork for our website that thanks to Kevin made me proud of the accomplishment. The girls of this town are very lucky to have a group of parents that care about them as much as we all do. We all should be proud of what we have done during the past 3+ years, I know I am. I did not join the board for just my 3 daughters but the almost 400 girls that belong to the Milton Girls Softball League. They are all the winners!!!<br><br>In closing I would like to thank you all for supporting me and my efforts. I have laid the foundation now go out and build it up. Publicly I would like to thank Gary for giving me the chance, Karen for letting me bother her when I needed to vent and needed help, and especially Kevin for everything he has done to help me look good. We worked hand in hand closely for all of my time on the board and has become a special friend as you all have as well. I will miss this as it was not an easy decision on my part. Good luck and I will see you at the field!!!!!<br><br>Kenny

          Kenny, I'm sorry that your stepping down, but understand your decision. I appreciate all you've done to help me, both of my daughters, and MGSL as a whole. I wish you the best moving forward, and am sure I'll see you plenty down at the ball fields watching our MGS graduates pursuing  their careers. Bill

          Kenny, thank you for all your hard work! You not only took the sponsorship role and ran with it but I think you completed a marathon with all your accomplishments. You raised money but more importantly you created relationships with Milton businesses. You will be missed, take care and I know our paths will cross so see you around town. Karen

          Kenny although I see you all the time at various rinks I wanted to publicly say that since my first involment with MGSB I have been impressed by your commitment and spirit and even more so when I joined the board.

          Hey Kenny<br>Thank you for all you have done over the years. Your fundraising efforts will benefit girls for many years to come long after our own girls have all moved on. You will be greatly missed but fortunately you have laid down solid foundation for the next person. I am sure I will see you on a field soon. Thanks again and Happy New Year!<br>Rich

          A few updates with regards to the Pre-Season Clinics:<br><br><ul>
<li>Time slots are 5-6:15p for Grades 3-5 and 6:30-7:45p for Grades 6-8.</li>
<li>Two "teams" have been set up on the site: Pre-Season Clinics (Grades 3-5) and Pre-Season Clinics (Grades 6-8)</li>
<li>Players who have registered as of today have been assigned to their respective group. <b> As of 1/20 6pm we have 52 for the first session and 32 for the 2nd session.</b>
</li>
<li>Girls will continue to be added throughout the week.</li>
<li>Schedules have been created with auto-reminders for each "team"</li>
<li>The reminders include the RSVP feature so we may be able to get a sense of how many to expect.<br>
</li>
</ul><br>I can provide a list of girls who have registered as we get closer to Sunday. This can be used to check-in girls as they arrive as well as make sure they have in fact registered.
