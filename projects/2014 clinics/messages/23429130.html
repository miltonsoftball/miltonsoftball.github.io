  <div class="content">
    Our pitching clinic that was to start the other night (Wednesday) was canceled due to the Armory not having someone there as scheduled to open.  I was at the Armory that day to confirm for that night, and everything was a go, personnel from the Armory never showed to open that night.<br><br>I meet the 7 pm group there to sign them in, we all waited till 7:20 and then let them know we will add this night onto the back end, and apologized for the inconvenience.  We contacted the 8 pm attendees to let them know of the issue and rescheduled everyone to start next Wed.<br><br>I did revisit the Armory to find out the issue, they assured us it will not happen in the future, the next 5 weeks are reconfirmed, and I was able to obtain the personal phone number of the expected employee of the Armory that will be opening.<br><br>One positive would be to see if we can fill up all 20 slots. Going into Wednesday night, we had 15 participants signed up, with 5 spots open.
