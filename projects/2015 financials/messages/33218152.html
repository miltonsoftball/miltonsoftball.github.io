    Here is the revised league breakdown per player to include a few other items we discussed (insurance, smaller items like balls, score books). What does this mean for our fee structure? <br><br>My opinion is the fee should reflect covering the cost of playing with a certain % going to league investments - like 10%. Then the sponsorship's go to the balance of investments. By adding fresh women to clinics, more $ invested in them, the cost should be fine. Other league fees may need to go up slightly. It really matters how many teams and players there are - the more the better! <br><br>Less pressing- Kevin can you give me a breakdown of summer to better reflect cost with uniform fees per age division?

          Calece I believe this was my last update for the summer uniforms. It will list exactly what teams and specifically what children ordered uniforms.
