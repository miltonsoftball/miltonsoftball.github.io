    <h2>Gile Field Lighting Update...</h1>

    Hey All, <br><br>I just wanted to pass along that it looks like there may be some recent progress on the Gile lights situation.  The baseball guys put together a meeting yesterday up at Gile with the Parks Dept., an Eversource Rep and engineer, as well as a local electrician.   <br><br>The fall out was this new Eversource contact seems amenable to the electrician's proposal they eliminate the current master meter.  Instead, each set of field lights would be metered as a separate account.  Most of the work would be done in the brick power house.   This plan would avoid costly trenching back to the street for new service lines for each field.   This was likely an engineering option the utility co ignored years ago for reasons unknown, (...maybe technology or policy reasons even).    <br><br>Regardless, this could be good news on the way for all who use the field lights.    Eversource still has to process the proposal.  They may take up to 60 days to review and respond to the electricians work order.   Besides individual control over lighting and scheduling, the big gain for all would be that no meter would be likely to top the 10,000 kw use threshold in a billing cycle.  That inflexible rate structure is what causes the monthly demand charges to skyrocket (...I am told the demand charge at least triples for an entire billing period any time the threshold is met for even one day.).  <br><br>Also, the Parks Dept was very interested in converting to LED.   This projects to save approx.  60 - 80% off the KW usage by just replacing the existing metal-halide bulbs.   The bulbs could be very pricey up front.   I guess we'll have wait to see how the Parks Dept. proposes to pay for that, or if any municipal rebate deals exist for the Town possibly.   This change to LED would however come with a separate, great long term cost benefit.   Using the lights would be much, much more affordable per hour for many years ahead.  <br><br>Should be more news on this in about 30 - 60 days.  I do know the electrician involved well enough to stay in contact with him directly.    As an aside, I will follow up with him for pricing the power to the approved scoreboard location, as well as to the backstop.   The thinking being, if this guy does end up doing the meter work maybe we dovetail in our other work while his attention is on Gile.  At the very least,  I'll aim to stay informed for MGS as long as I have access to the guys driving this. <br><br>Back to school in about two weeks! Enjoy the rest of the summer everyone!<br><br>-Bill Gio.

          Thanks for the update and effort, seems to be very promising on more than one front, metering and energy saving LED too!

          Hello Board,<br><br>We have some exciting news on the Gile light project. <br><br>As you know we have been working with the town, Milton American, and Milton National to come up with a plan to get all the lights at Gile on separate meters. <br><br>Eversource came onsite and did a site survey. We then received an estimate for the job from a local electrician. All the parties met earlier this week to review the estimate and determine a fair way to divide up the cost. Our responsibility will be under 3k. The exact number will be shared as soon as soon as I receive confirmation from Dave Perdios. <br><br>Regardless of the exact number, we made enough progress to schedule the electrician. The project will begin on October 12th and take about one week to complete. <br><br>We are also working with the electrian to provide estimates on running power to the softball backstop and supplying power for the scoreboard.  We hope to have this work done at the same time. <br><br>Over the next week I'll be working with Gary to nail down the power requirements for the scoreboard. <br><br>Big thanks to Gio for all his work behind the scenes!  <br><br>Great progress on resolving an issue that has been around for a few decades. <br><br>Kevin

          Thanks Lloyd.   Baseball pushed this through with Parks .  I just know those guys, one of whom knows a guy at Eversource that we could collectively convince to look at it differently.  <br><br>It was high time this was solved.   Timing is sometimes everything I guess and very glad to see this happen!

          Hi everyone,<br><br>We have an update on the great progress being made at Gile:<br><br><b>Meters/Lights</b><br>After some brief negotiation, the project cost and responsibilities by party are outlined below:<br><div><br></div><div><b><i>Project Cost:  $8,259</i></b></div><div>- Deduct American LL $500 and Federal League $1,000 contribution for new total of $6,759</div><div> ______________________<br>Remaining Balance:  $6,759</div><div> </div><div>Remaining Breakdown:</div><div>Park Dept:  $1,689.75   (25% of remaining balance)</div><div> </div><div>New Remaining Balance: $5,069.25</div><div>- National LL:  $2,534.63  (50% of new remaining balance)</div><div><b>- Milton Girls Softball:  $2,534.63  (50% of new remaining balance)</b></div><div> </div><div>This cost is well below initial estimates. We also reflects a savings of several hundred through some discussions and "negotiations" with Dave P. at Milton Parks.<br><br><br><b>Installation</b>
</div>As of Friday night, the meter installation project is 90% done. One more meter needs to be installed. This should be done by Tuesday.<br><br>Once completed we will get our inspection the following day and then the inspector will call it in to Eversource. The timeframe for Eversource to approve it is about 2 weeks - so by 10/31 we should be complete.<br><br><div>Gio and I met with the electrician this morning to do a site survey regarding the scoreboard placement as well as supplying power to the backstop.<br><br>We will have a quote from the electrician on Monday to provide 1) the 120v feed to the sign and 2) the backstop outlet (with wire gauge large enough to eventually support a future 60-100 amp panel in the future).<br><br><b>We are making great progress and more to come. Stay tuned...</b>
