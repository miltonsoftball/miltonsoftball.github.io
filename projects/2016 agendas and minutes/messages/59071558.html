    Hello all -<br><br>Thanks for your time at the board meeting earlier this week. Hard to believe another Spring Season is winding down.<br><br>The plan is to send out the Spring Season Ending Survey on Sunday or Monday. This is sent to all the parents/players in the program. If you have any questions you'd like to include, please post them here. They can be general league-wide questions or specific to a division.Â <br><br>Please send me your thoughts by Saturday.<br><br>Kevin
