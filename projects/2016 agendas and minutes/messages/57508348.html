          Brian,<br><br>Since I can't be at the meeting Monday night ...<br><br>- No comments to April Minutes.<br><br>New Business, (If it is pertinent to this Board Meeting):<br><br>- I'll distribute a plan soon for the Skills Challenge event and solicit<br>help from those who put their name down for that.<br><br>- All Star Day we can do hot dogs again wanted.  To those who signed up<br>for that... How about adding grilled sausage w/t pepper and onions?<br><br>- We did experience a no-show umpire on our first Jr game (Rangers v<br>Giants).  Both the Umpire Coordinator &amp; Pres. know about that.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>-Bill Gio.
