          Thanks everyone for the feedback. <br><br>Registrations are progressing well. <br><br>We will be running in the Milton Times over the next two weeks.<br><br><b>Lloyd</b>- would you be able to promote registration in the typical channels - Path, Facebook, Twitter, etc.<br><br><b>Calece</b> - Thanks for reaching out to Tucker. Attached is what we can used to promote registration. If you need printouts, let me know.<br><br><b><i>Could someone look into promoting in the PTO emails or through the other schools? Also, does anyone want to connect with St. Mary's and St. Agatha's?</i></b>

          Thanks Lloyd. We are moving the first clinic from coming Sunday to Friday night instead to avoid Pats game and potential snowstorm.
