    Hi everyone,<br><br>We have been doing some research on the scoreboard type by looking at size, style, and functionality. Please take a look at the link below. It has all the details regarding the scoreboard we recommend and buy for Gile Field. The goal would be to get this ordered soon so it can be installed in March.<br><br>We would love your thoughts by Saturday if possible.<br><br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KRikN1XIvPe7-6HBOfMFTbn7COzLraDTH1f_R1YYa6g/edit" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KRikN1XIvPe7-6HBOfMFTbn7COzLraDTH1f_R1YYa6g/edit</a>

          I think it looks fantastic.  Great product - seems like a reasonable price, especially if we get some relief on the install.

          It looks great, but $19K is more than I remember from the fall.  As I recall from the last Board meeting we have a balance of about $25K after a year where we spent very little for equipment.  In the last 2 years we have spent money for the lights and re-grading the infield at Gile.  Spending $19K is more than both of those combined and would leave us with very little reserve.

          I like the look of the scoreboard. Have a bit of a feeling that the board<br>could read 'Milton Softball' in red and white instead of our MGS logo...I<br>know we're the ones sponsoring it but with it being the high school main<br>field it may be nice for it to be more generic.<br><br>On the cost, I believe Blue Hills Bank will pay $5,000 ($1,000 each year<br>over the next 5 years) for sponsorship of the board so our out of pocket<br>cost would be lower. Combined with lower install costs it seems doable.<br>Though I'd love to know a final cost. Nick is right on our balance sheet -<br>we have $25k total...so spending $19k is a huge commitment.

          I love the look.  One suggestion.  Could we add the coaches names of the previous seasons champs? Preferably of the Junior division.

          Hahaha - Tommy. :-)<br>I really like the layout of the scoreboard.  Are there going to be different color reds or is the main body and the word 'MILTON' going to be the same color?  I love the color cohesiveness of the 'Pirates' board.

          I think I agree with Calese that it may be more appropriate to write "Milton Softball" in a generic format rather than use a private logo.  It's our field, but it's a Town field. <br><br>On cost, I think we bite the bullet. We know we have a shot at saving on the install.  If we set a budget for equipment purchases needed in 2017 and 2018, add in this expense and any other Capex items desired ...look at it as a 24 month plan ... it might be fine.  Saving is great, but the cash is to spend every year to amp up the experience for the kids.  <br><br>There seems to be enough cash flow to manage all the small things year-over-year.  Large Capex items of the magnitude we've been considering will likely only come from saving up operations surplus and emptying the account every couple of years. Or, through specifically targeted fundraising efforts for big ideas.  If that is the case then we really have little need for cash large cash assets (a true non profit structure). <br><br>Maybe for budgeting purposes we choose a policy of keeping a minimum balance equal to one seasons worth of retail purchases (not fees and training costs, but bats and balls,etc...). Assume registrations will cover the operational service costs like umpires, field fees and the like. Then just pick something to spend the rest on each year.  <br><br>Not sure the above looks in numbers, but maybe what reasonable amount in the bank would be the right minimum to always be able to comfortably operate (not pay for entirely, but operate month to month) through a one year cycle?  Sorry if this has already been discussed in depth in the past, but just hoping it helps regarding the decision to drop this amount of cash at this time.
