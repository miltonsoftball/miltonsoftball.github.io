          I will definitely leave the power cords in the Gile Box early Sat.    Just leave them in there at end of day.  <br><br>My Sat is still up in the air and I may not be able to get up to the field to be much help.    Will do my best if I get a window to swing by and lend a hand.  Clean up time might be my best shot at that.

          Hi all,<br><br>Favor to ask. If I don't make it back to Gile tonight (3 grad parties), can someone drop the PA system and small table at my house? A buddy of mine is going to grab it in the morning for his party. <br><br>Thanks!

          Great games and great day. Congrats to Rays, Cubs and Athletics! Thanks to all who helped make it a great day. <br><br>Not sure who was part of the close up crew but could you bring the tent, banners, tshirts and anything else you grabbed out of storage to extra storage on Monday night when we have equipment drop off?<br><br>Also looking for a few volunteers on Monday night for equipment drop-off.  Dana and I will be there but we are leaving our practices to get there. We could use a few more bodies. <br><br>Please reply back when you can.

          I know Dana was going to swim back today.  However, I am at Gile for the scrimmage this AM and can probably just collect a lot of it.  I cannot make equipment drop tomorrow night. Will talk to Ted about the key for storage and maybe we can get in there later this afternoon.<br><br>Sent from my iPhone

          Thanks to everyone who helped out for a sussessful event at Gile yesterday. Particular thanks to Calece who organized and stayed most of day and night. Shout out also to Shauna, who helped out with fields and stayed much of afternoon and Nick, who put in overtime through extra inning Sr game and broke down everything until around 10:30PM.
