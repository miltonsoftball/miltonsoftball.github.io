    Should we have a clinic covering all aspects for all in the league, divided by age or division?  Aside from the pitching clinics.  Vacation time slots will be taken at the gyms I think.  We might be able to get Glover.  These type of clinics could be good revenue generators.  Parents like to find things for the kids that do not go away during vacation.

        <div class="content">
          I think clinics should be split up into categories:<br><br><ul>
<li>Coaching</li>
<li>Pitching</li>
<li>Hitting</li>
<li>Fundamentals</li>
</ul><br>Each category could be split into age groups (some age groups could be combined).<br><br>Glover could work but it's tight and somewhat limiting.  I thinking exploring Dirt Dogs and TJOs should be considered.<br><br>I hope this helps.
