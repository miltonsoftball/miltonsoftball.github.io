          The link worked great.  It looks great, thanks.<br><br>I think we should put it in the Times by noon tomorrow for it to run next Friday.  It may not be worth the expense, but I think it is important for the program's visibility  what we are doing.<br><br>I will actually address the expense with the two vendors and approach them that I would like to deduct it from what we pay them.  Since we are doing all the registration work, etc.<br><br>Kev, I think the ad we put in for registration was $256, if I get $128 from each vendor that will be the goal.<br><br>Do you want me to send the rough draft of the copy to Karen, you have been crazy busy getting the roster/coaches stuff done.

          I am not sure we need to run it in the Times.  Here is my thinking:<br><ul>
<li>We are targeting these clinics to existing girls in the program.  This equates to 71 girls in the Senior Division and 77 girls in the Junior Division.  This is the target audience.</li>
<li>Email and the website will reach these girls/parents</li>
<li>Running it in the Times means that it will appear on 3/14 with the clinics starting 4 days later.  Not at lot of time to get the message out and exposed.</li>
<li>I think the visibility is important but can be accomplished in other ways</li>
</ul>Another approach may sent a blurb to Ed Baker.  Often times he will run what you send him.  Or maybe send it to the Around the Town in the Times promoting events.  We could also post it in the Milton Patch for free.<br><br>If you can get a commitment from each clinic, maybe we create an ad to promote a future clinic (hitting, etc.)?

          i have updated the registration with the dates you provided.  Do you have enough support with your clinic committee to have coverage at both locations since they are both happening at the same time?  Should we recruit board members?<br><br>I think it's important to have a league presence - especially in a leadership role.

          With the clinics being on the same night, I am waiting to hear back, but it should not be a problem.  I will know by our meeting next week if we need to reach out.  <br><br>With only having 6 teams in the senior division, I would think most coaches will want to attend to get a glimpse of the future draft pool.  3 of our board members look to be Senior div coaches.  The Jr division, Mike Kinsella would like to help as well, along with our people.<br><br>The objective is to have MGSA reps at each location, and be involved to the extent it makes it inviting to the attendees

          The ad is not intended for only our targeted audience  it is for the community as well as our sponsors, and future softball players, etc.  <br><br>It is not to create more attendees (positive if it does last minute), visibility within our softball community is smaller than perceived, visibility for our town, since we are a town recreational program I think is money well spent, part of our mission.

          What you are describing is a PR effort.  There are more effective ways of communicating our message to the Milton Community than running a print ad.  If you have concerns about our visibility (smaller than perceived?), we should chat about it and work with Jen as the chair of the PR Committee.<br><br>That being said, share with me what you envision for the messaging and from there a decision can be made.  Thanks.

          Thats okay, I am to late with this anyway.  The envisionment is to inform others than our email membership what MGSA is doing.  We can work with Jen and see what is best.

          Gary - can you let us know who you have booked to staff each clinic?  Since the timeframe overlaps, I know you can't be in two places at once. I am unavailable for the first two March ones (team banquets each Monday) but could possible help out at the April one.   <br><br>What did we decide about the board meeting conflict on the 8th?

          I have had a nice response by the board and some coaches. I will be at Dirt Dawg for registration and then head over to TJO for registration.<br><br>At Dirt Dawg we will have the following for help, registration, etc.<br>*Gary Kelly<br>*Brian Conroy<br>*Bill Vaughn<br>*Smokey Rulon<br><br>At TJO we should have- at a minimum<br>Gary<br>Laurie<br>Ted<br><br>The conflict on the 8th was determined it would only affect  couple of board members, so its best to carry on with the meeting for the majority.

          Both clinics went well this evening, both well attended.  The 5/6 grade had 25 out of the 29 preregistered players attend.  The 7/8 at TJO had 22 out of the 25 registered attend.  We collected a total of one check ($40, Scarborough) out of both clinics, all others were online payments.<br><br>We had 4 coaches at Dirt Dawg, and 3 coaches at TJO.<br><br>I have emailed all coaches that attended and have asked for comments, I will update once I receive them.

          I wanted to do a survey to the girls/parents who attended the pre-season clinics.  Anything you want to include?  Can you get me any questions you'd like to include by Saturday?  I plan to send the survey out over the weekend.  Thanks.

          Great idea! I would get the list of topics we said would be covered and ask them if those topics were covered. I would also ask what they thought was missing for future clinics. Most important did it help the girls.
