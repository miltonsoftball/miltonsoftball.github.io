          Thanks for providing the info. I am happy to send out an email.<br><br>I think we discussed this during the board meeting but 6/10 is the start of the playoffs for two divisions.  How did you want to handle?  <br><br>Also, the cost of $60 for 3 sessions?  Didn't we previously charge $60 for 4 sessions?<br><br>Let me know.
