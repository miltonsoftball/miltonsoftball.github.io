    Hello Board!<br><br>I have been working on an online store on and off again over the past few years.  I have tried products from Cafepress, SquidLocker and others but was never really happy with the quality of the service and products they provided.  <br><br>Cafepress recently launched a new interface.  The tool provided me with a lot of room to customize the products offered as well as manage the look and feel of the website.  <br><br>The result is our official online store.  The store will not replace SuperFlash as our source for uniforms and equipment but it will provide members of the softball community with a place to purchase of wide variety of Milton Girls Softball products.  I created some custom apparel and if you think of other ideas, let me know.  I am happy to add more product.<br><br>Let me know what you think.  I plan to launch it publically later this week. Feedback welcome!<br> <br><b><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.cafepress.com/miltonsoftball" target="_blank">http://www.cafepress.com/miltonsoftball</a></b>

          Good idea.  I added some sweatpants for the women.  Cafepress didn't offer any for the men.  I did add PJs for the men and women.<br><br>P.S. Brian - I sent you a link to the thong under a separate email. (I am not kidding, they do offer them).

          We can mark up product as much as we want.  I did a blanket % increase across the board of 15% I think.  If any prices look out of whack, let me know.

          Just got a chance to look at this. Good job Kevin. At first glance, my suggestions would be to add at least one or two visor products to hat section, and drink products seem pricey.  It's nice to have an online store though.

          Unfortunately there are not any visors I can add to the inventory.<br><br>The drink products are expensive but the base price is set by Cafepress.  I only marked these products by 10%.
