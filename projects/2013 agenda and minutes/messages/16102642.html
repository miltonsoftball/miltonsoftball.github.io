          Sorry been out of the loop. Did not receive Friday's post. Have been away at Family Weekend at Sacred Heart to see Elizabeth. Just got home and unfortunately cannot help Sunday. At hockey and softball with Caroline and Izzy. Wish I had known earlier would have tried to make other arrangements.
