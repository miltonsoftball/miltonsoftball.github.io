          Last night's meeting did not go as planned, I would like to come back to the Board of Directors with a proposal as to how we recover and move forward. The Executive Board will meet over the next 2 weeks to come up with that plan.<br><br>I respectfully ask everyone that attended last night's meeting...please do not discuss what happened in our meeting outside of the Board of Directors. Milton Girls Softball has made great strides with the Milton community, there is nothing to gain from having outside conversations and to be honest a lot to lose. <br><br>Our next meeting is scheduled for Mon., 9/23 at 7pm Cunningham Hall. Please make every effort to attend this meeting. Thank you, in advance, for your help and cooperation.

          Kevin, Gary and I met last night and we want to meet with you next Monday, 9/16 instead of 9/23. We have a plan and want to discuss it with all of you, please make every effort to attend this meeting. I scheduled the Milton library conference room in the basement. See you next Monday and thank you for your continued support.
