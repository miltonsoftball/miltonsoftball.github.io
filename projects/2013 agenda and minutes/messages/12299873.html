    Good news!<br><br>Much to our surprise, Gile Road is getting new dirt today (Monday).  We had hoped to be part of a discussion about the type of dirt and the irrigation system but it appears the town proceeded without us.<br><br>Gary confirmed with the town that the field will be playable for this evening.  Fingers crossed.

          That's great! <br><br>I wanted to let you know that there is only 1 bag of the quick-dry left at Gile. We needed a good amount yesterday to make Gile playable. Not sure what is left at the other fields, but maybe we can take some from one of the other fields for Gile. If not, would need to buy more.<br><br>I should be available to help during the day on Saturday, will let you know for sure once I know what times i can be there.

          You will not be able to touch Gile today. The field as of 12:00Noon is under construction. They are reskinning the field and grading it. I spoke to the construction company and they said barring any rain which it is raining out now they might be done today. I have talked to Kevin and told him I will get an update around 3pm. You cannot use any drying material till the field is all set. We will void any warranty that the company provides the town on their repairs. Hopefully with using the lazer they have it will drain better and not puddle. I will keep you posted.

          Just communicated with Dave Peridos, field is just about done.  He said it is coming out great, and will be ready for tonight, barring any heavy rain.<br><br>As mentioned in prior thread, this was a last minute surprise, as the company doing the work, had a cancellation, and Peridos pulled the trigger.  The good news after discussion with Dave, is that he did choose to go with a better material, which has a heavier mixture of clay, which will hopefully hold down the dust issues.  We discussed the irrigation,  and he of course wanted to get the field done, as the opportunity arose, and as he mentioned the irrigation can be done at any time, and will be evaluated for a new system or potential of one, when they do Kelley field.  We are working on getting new irrigation at Kelley as well, and working on location and electrical of box.<br><br>It is going to be great to see the new material, with new regrading, and pitch.  This is expected to take care of plate issues, along with better draining.  We are expecting not to have the mini ponds behind short,third and 2nd for that matter.  Karen already took pictures of the work being done, it looks great.

          Just a follow up on Gile field since the new material.  From most accounts, it has been holding up great, the last thunderstorm it was challenged with, I went by to check for a game, and to my surprise there was NO water on any of the field.  In past, it would have had the usual areas holding some water.  <br><br>I did hear from Dave Peridos yesterday, asking if we have had any reports of any injuries, due to a broken bench and pole.  (the bench at the top of the field at the parking lot).  He received a report yesterday, of an injury Monday night, due to the broken bench.<br><br>Dave apologized and said he is at that field almost daily, and never even noticed the bench was broken, as they are usually lower at the field and not at the top of the parking lot.  <br><br>I was not aware it was a hazard, the Park and rec have blocked it off and are planning on removing the broken post and will look to see it it needs new footings to replace or if it can be replaced in current position.<br><br>I believe Dana had a game there on Monday night, if anyone is aware of any injuries or cuts, please let me know, Dave Perdios is trying to contact the person.<br><br>We have been asking to get other fields in better shape in letting the Park and Rec know it is a quick season.  I believe all fields were lined for games, but it looks like they did not get to Andrews to improve.
