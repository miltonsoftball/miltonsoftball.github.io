          Good Morning, I was wondering if, with all of the rain that we are expected to get today, tonight and into the early hours tomorrow, if there should be a discussion about just canceling all games for the day? <br><br>I just think that most of the field are going to be a mess for the early games, and may dry out for later in the day. I know Gile will be wet for most of the day, the others may be ok. If we were to cancel all game, it would have the games played equal for all divisions, except the Sophomore since they have the odd number of teams. Just seems like the fair way to do it as opposed to uneven numbers of games played for the standing for the start of playoff week. <br><br>Not sure if this would be an EB discussion or full board, so if this is an EB discussion and decision, than please disregard this post!

          Very rarely do we cancel all the games in a day unless Park and Rec instructs us to.  We never know how the fields are going to be in a few hours - especially if they are worked on.<br><br>As it turns out, we had several games that were able to play Saturday that otherwise would not have for this very reason.<br><br>We lucked out and the Seniors ended up playing a complete season.
