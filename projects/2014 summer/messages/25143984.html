    Summer tryouts are scheduled for 5/18.  We need to have tryouts for U10, U12, U14 and U18. We need to get the word out regarding times for each age group. Does someone want to take the lead in setting up the time slots?<br><br>Do we want to run them?  Do we hire Dirt Dawgs to run and/or evaluate?<br><br>Happy to have a call or a meeting to discuss.

          Email sent out to coaches. I suggest tryouts at Kelly on 18th as follows: U10 9:00-10:30, U12 11:00-12:30, U14  1:00-2:30, U18 3:00-4:30.  Would have to move Rockies practice at 3pm to another field.

          I can help start asking for commitments to evaluate.  Are we looking for 5 people to evaluate every age group? Are prospective coaches not part of process of picking their own teams? This is probably worthy of decent amount of discussion at BOD meeting.

          Neither myself or Laureen got an email about summer travel. Did it go out to all potential parents?

          Okay, I am not going crazy.  <br><br>I emailed the website support and they confirmed a bug with sending emails (since this was the second one I had issues with).  It involved selecting multiple groups.  They shared with me a workaround and I resent the email.<br><br>Bill - you should also have a U18 specific email.<br><br>Let me know if you receive them.<br><br>And please confirm I am not losing it.

          Honestly, I think we need to nail this down before Monday.  Also, opening it up to the board may result in 12 opinions.  I think this group is better served discussion and making the decisions.<br><br>My suggestion is at least 3 evaluators (ideally more) and at least 4-5 adults running three stations for each the tryout.  I have attached what has been created in the past but I will be fine with whatever the group decides.<br><br>Two of the docs are for the evaluation.<br><br>The other is how the tryout was structured.

          For the sake of time and simplicity, this format seems to work. It's well structured and timed out. Getting the right evaluators is key.

          I had a discussion with Bill last night on some thoughts and ideas on Summer ball.  Dont want to write a book here, so will let Bill take away whatever he thought from a big picture standpoint, along with the shorter term tactical thoughts.  Listed below are just a few of what I think might be more critical. <br><br>* Do you repackage summer, and communicate a change- i.e. - The first team will be the A team, a summer all star team, which will have different expectations of our regular travel program.  A combination of Travel and a minimum of 2 or 3 tourneys.  A vast difference in Commitment (something that is lacking in the summer program)<br>*A boots on the ground campaign for coaches- Bill started this with a good email going out to spring coaches.  This does not change much from years past, but a focus needs to be on the upcoming coaches of who is eager to have their child continue to play at a higher level, and mingle in the sandbox.<br>*You hope summer coaches are some of the better coaches in the program- it attracts and builds for future teams.<br>*Outsourcing Tryouts has alot of pros going for it.  Probably a good idea.  If its done, I believe the timing should be sensitive towards the view if its creating more of an elitist persona, and kids are less apt to come try out.  (maybe thats okay to, depending on the numbers expected, and objective)<br>*Evaluations in house have come along way (thanks to a great deal of Kevins work with organizing the formats and a joint goal of trying to make it a quantitative and qualitative process.  In house I think continues to help keep the tryout community closer knit and possibly allow to build and attract.<br>*We are paying the price for a strategic decision (years back) to have the Travel league be more accommodating to summer schedules and try to attract quantity, and not so much quality (except for team one picked).  We have come along way, 12 years ago, we had usually 2 or 3 travel teams.  Over the last 7-8 years, we have been as high as 7, and been averaging 6.  I guess we can take the positive road,  and realize lots more kids playing summer ball. (this is where the that whole big picture, mission and objective of summer probably needs a little more help)<br><br>So much for not writing a book...

          <br>I agree with Kevin on his points on getting it nailed down with this group, and doing it now.<br><br>I believe if tryouts are in house, we do our best to control who is doing which task and try to build our team of what will create a very organized, well run tryout, with the coaches we have knowing what is going to be done for that each hour and half of tryout time.<br><br>Kevins numbers have proven to work well, with at least 3 elevators, and agreed more if you know who you have.  Key part of the whole process,  Kev and I have said for years, you need to be able to trust the elevator skill, as not everyone's average score of 2.5 is the same.<br><br>Unfortunately, I will have trouble making it to the tryouts, and I love the tryouts, but my daughter is graduating that weekend, and we will be away, and the plan right now is to leave Maine Sunday am, and hope to make the U12 and U14, but I realize that is not of much help from a planning standpoint.  I think the U18 is not neccessary, imo.  (smaller pool of players)<br><br>I can see if Steve Pelleriti is available, and we should see if Mike Kinsella is free.  Fitz has been there for a number of years.  Depending on schedules of Kevin, Bill and Ted, you have 3 or 4 excellent evaluators out of that whole group right there.<br><br>I would love to help heading right into the tryouts, let me know how I can.  I think we can look to U10 and U12 Dads, (Coaches in Sr, Jr, Soph), and look to pull in any that are hoping to either have their daughter play at a higher level or travel ball.  Have these guys help at certain stations.  <br><br>The docs kev has posted are great, and should be looked at to see if any tweaking is needed, but probably not.  <br><br>I think tryouts should be listed in the times as well (does not have to be an Ad, in the happenings or events)<br><br>Also need a plan for makeup date (or plan) for those that could not make tryouts.<br><br>As Kevin knows, the data after is what needs to be turnaround and give the parents a date at the tryouts of when you will be able to notify them.<br><br>Coaching vacancies are always a concern going into the tryouts, the goal has always been to try to have some of your best coaches hopefully be coaching the A team, and fill the B with a parent from the roster, worst case scenario.<br>
