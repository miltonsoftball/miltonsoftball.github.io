          Shawn- the uniforms will not be ready until Sunday at the earliest. SuperFlash is working as fast as they can and are doing a great job considering they received the order late. As soon as we know, we will let you know. It's going down to the wire.

          Any updates on uniforms, equipment, or game balls?  I have some obligations later today/tonight so not sure how long/when I will be around.  Let me know what you think... thanks...<br><br>Also, is there an updated rules outline I can look at?  Wasn't able to make any of the summer meetings, but have some questions (for U12):<br><br>- Is there only three outfielders in U12<br>- is the infield fly rule in effect<br>- can a batter run on a dropped third strike<br>- do we pay umps $50 each home game<br>- can runners steal home<br>- is the mount 44 ft from the plate<br><br>any other summer rules we need to know about?<br><br>Looking forward to a great season.

          To answer a few of the questions<br>3 outfields<br>Infield fly exists<br>Dropped third strike exists<br>Stealing- player can leave on release not when ball crosses plate- definitely something to work on big difference
