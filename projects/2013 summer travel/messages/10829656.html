    <h2>Summer Tryouts</h1>

  <div class="content">
    Originally, the game plan was to hold summer tryouts this year at the Dirt Dawg Facility, as they offered to help run them and evaluate players.  We had a date of this Sunday April 28th, it was not posted anywhere on the website or communicated to the league, so we will move it out a week.  With the parade being moved to this Saturday, and talking with DD owners over the weekend, its best.   It does not appear that DD would be able to offer us a significant benefit, vs us doing it as we have in the past.  In the future, if they can hold the tryouts, run them, and evaluate them, it may be worthwhile, but at this point, it would cost us money to use the facility and hire their people, (which is a change from earlier discussions).  <br><br>If our goal is to hold tryouts earlier in the year, say March or April, next year, it may be worth using a indoor facility next year.<br><br>We will hold the summer tryouts on Sunday May 5th, for U10, U12, U14, at Kelley Field, from 12-3pm.  U14, at noon, U12 at 1pm, U10 at 2pm.  We usually have an alternate date if need be, we will use May 6th, Monday night, if we need to.<br><br>As a board, it would be great to have you weigh in with any changes you think would help the process.  We will look to have a similar set up as in the past, having 3 stations, hitting, infielding, outfielding.  With two evaluators at each station.  The evaluators I think should be coaches or qualified people that will not be coaching in the summer, as the summer coaches can help run the stations.  Please let me know if you are available to help.<br><br>As for summer coaches, we have not used the same process as the spring.  The most important consideration for summer coaching, is prior history coaching in Tournament or summer league ball.  <br><br>As a league, we also need to formulate a strategy for U16 and or U18.  Should we offer this to our community? How do we do it?  We have some prior history with trying to help coordinate efforts with the HS players, should we leverage off of that?  What we learned and what we would change.<br><br>Also as a league, I think we need to evaluate, do we want to grow the summer program similar to other communities like Franklin, Walpole, Newton, Mansfield? Or can we?  Most of the communities are bigger and have grown the summer program to offer the Travel league (our Hock league) and Tournament teams.<br><br>Next step will be to communicate the tryouts to the teams and league, and community. U14 tryouts are open to girls that live in Milton (they do not have to be part of the program, as long they reside in Milton), the U12 and U10 have to have played in the spring league.

          Sounds like a good plan to move it out a week since we have not been able to promote it. I only have 2 questions....Can we reschedule all of the games for that Sunday to accommodate the tryout times? And is an hour for each division enough time to evaluate the girls properly?? I say this because we might have a lot of girls in different age groups. In the past we have given each age group more than an hour at least 90 min.??

          I am confused why we are moving it out a week? The 4/28 date has been promoted and communicated on the website ever since the date was set.  I posted on Basecamp on 3/21 asking for more information but you have been radio silent about the logistics except to say it was going to be at DD and facilitated by them.<br><br>You never communicated any times or how it was going to work. <br><br>We should discuss before any changes are made.  Call at your convenience.

          <p>I suggest grouping the girls in age divisions U12 and U14
into 3 groups prior to the tryouts</p>

<p>Group 1: Returning A and B team players, and in U14 high
school players</p>

<p> Group 2:  A team players moving up to higher age group</p>

<p>Group: 3   B team players moving up and new to summer players</p>

<p>I think this will make it easier for evaluators to make
distinctions between players if they are already in their, presumably,
appropriate groups.  Evaluators could
then evaluate within the smaller group instead of having to consider the entire
larger group. Time permitting; players could be moved to different groups if
needed.</p>

<p>  U10 could be grouped
somewhat similar minus the moving up part.</p>

<p>Also, when forming  all teams it should be considered that
Hockomock league  rules allow  B team players to play up and could allow for
our B teams to  carry a potential A team
pitcher and/or catcher, if it is the players desired position to play, versus
playing out of position at A  Level . </p>
