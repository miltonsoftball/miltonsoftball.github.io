    Hi Board!<br><br>Hope everyone is doing well.<br><br>I want to share with you some feedback we received at our U18 game on Wednesday. We were in South Braintree and as we were packing up and leaving, the umpire walked over and wanted to tell us that he is very impressed with the Milton Girls Softball Program. He said he has umpired a lot of Milton Girls Games and he feels we have an outstanding program and run a great program. We thanked him and said we appreciated the feedback. <br><br>I then apologized for barking at the two bad calls he had (just kidding!).<br><br>Good stuff.
