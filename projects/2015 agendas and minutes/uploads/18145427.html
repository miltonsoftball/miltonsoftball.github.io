          Agenda Item<br><br>In speaking with Larry Rooney he had asked about minority registrations and if we had any observations or challenges.<br><br>He said they are planning on doing a your sports information night at Tucker. Asked if we did hardship or reduced rate on needed basis and also car pool forms or requests for parents who can't get their kids to game due to work schedules.<br><br>I told him we would add as discussion at board meeting.
