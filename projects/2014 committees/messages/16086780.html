          One request for the 2014 Rules - halfway through last year (approx) Freshwoman were requested to call the players 'out' at first base. Up till then everyone was safe regardless if they were thrown out. I don't have an opinion but the rules need to be clear to coaches from the beginning (are players also called out at second?). Only about half the coaches wanted to call the girls out last year which I'm not sure if due to the fact that it was a change or a strong feeling that it's better to have the players on base to learn running the bases. Thank you!!!

          Experienced the same, it wasn't consistent between Coach's how they wanted to handle it.<br><br>Two things I observed shaping my opinion (submitted to year end survey); 4-5 girls were in their 3rd year of Freshwomen - excited to be playing with "outs" and progressing in competition.  Other girls in their first  or second year, from K - 2, and I think keeping them on base keeps them interested in game and coming back (growing the game).<br><br>I haven't seen the Junior Division yet play but 3-4 of those freshwomen girls played on the 10B summer travel and made the transition from Freshwomen to girls pitch and competitive focus and handled themselves well.  Thinking that it's possible a "3rd year Freshwomen" could be better served playing up if the girls, parents and previous coach agree.  Not sure how many we have that fit 3rd consecutive year.<br><br>Lloyd

          Good input. We will clarify this by start of season. My opinion is that while good to keep the girls reaching base interested, it's also important for self esteem of  both fielders who make a fielded out ( not an easy task) be rewarded for this also. We do allow girls who have advanced ability to "play up" to the next level, though the process for determining this is an action item for us right now as well.

          Every girl in the freshman level will end the year with a on-base percentage of .990 -meaning they will get on base almost every time up.  There are very few "natural outs" the ones that are-let them be outs.

          We need to keep this fun for all the girls and at the same time teach them the game of softball.

          Sorry for short notice but rules committee will be meeting tonight at 7. If you get this and have any suggestions, please let us know and we will discuss. So far, on docket we have stealing at junior level and putouts at 1st base for freshman.

          Add to that leaving on release- I have research stating we are the only town in the bay state league (Spring rec leagues) that does not - not only at senior level but for the majority at junior level as well- something to debate!

          Hello all -<br><br>Me again!<br><br><div>We had a rule in place at the Senior Level that required all girls to slide when there was a play at a base. This is OUR rule and not an ASA rule.  After discussing this rule with ASA, it was strongly recommended we follow the ASA rule as umpires will go by ASA rules even if we have a different rule in place for our program.</div><div><br></div><div>We have decide to abide by the ASA rule.  The new rule states that girls must slide OR avoid contact.  </div><div><br></div><div>The rule now reads:</div><div>
<div><ol><li>
<b>Players must slide OR avoid contact. All sliding rule decisions are at the discretion of the umpire.</b> In order to prevent injury and protect a defensive player attempting to make a play, the runner will be called out (runner interference) if they crash into a defensive player holding the ball, preparing to apply a tag or positioning herself to catch a thrown or hit ball. To avoid interference the runner can slide, jump over the top of the player, or run around the player without being called out (even if forced to go outside the base path). If the runner is called out for interference the ball becomes dead. In summary, it is the runner’s responsibility to avoid crashing into a defensive player.</li></ol></div>
<div><br></div>
</div><div>The rules have been updated on the website as well.</div>
