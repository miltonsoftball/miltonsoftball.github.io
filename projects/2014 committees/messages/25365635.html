    <h2>Player Agent Program</h1>

    Hello everyone.  <br><br>I want to let you know that we have kicked off the Player Agent program for the Senior Division.  With Senior Team numbers in a very tough spot this year, this program allows Senior Coaches to make a request to fill a roster for a game where the team may otherwise be shorthanded. <br><br><div>The program provides 5th/6th graders who are interested in occasionally "playing up" in Senior Division games the opportunity to do so as long as it does not conflict with their Junior Division Game Schedule.</div><div><br></div><div>
<b>Sydney FitzGerald</b> - no relation to Rich, pure coincidence on the last name and home address :)  - has volunteered to be the "Player's Agent" for the 2014 season. She is not connect to any team in any way.  She is independent and truly the Player's Agent.  She is working off a list of 5th/6th graders who have expressed interest in playing up in a Senior Division Game.  She will go down the 6th list in order of submission until all Senior Coach requests have been met.<br><br>The program has been communicated to Senior Coaches and the parents of 5th/6th grade girls who signed up for the program.<br><br>Please share any feedback you hear.</div>
