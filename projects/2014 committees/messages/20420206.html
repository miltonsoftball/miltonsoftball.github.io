          Great stuff Lloyd.  Thank you!<br><br>Per your other post, I am open to you working with Travel Soccer and explore how the schedules can align.  My past experience with Travel Soccer is that your home games may be at the same time week to week but the away games could vary.  Maybe it's changed?   And there are the group of parents who will not shuttle the girls around to make both regardless if the conflict doesn't exist.  <br><br>If you want to open the communication lines with soccer and lacrosse, it would be great.<br><br>In terms of capturing if they play other sports, we have had the following on our registration form for a few years:<br><br><u><strong><i>Extracurricular Activities</i></strong></u><br><i>Softball games are typically at 5:45p during the week and on Saturdays.  </i><br><br><i>Does your daughter have any other commitments that may preclude her from playing in the majority of her softball games?  If so, please elaborate.</i>

<li>posting on home page of website</li>

</ul><b><u><br></u></b><b><u>Targeted Direct Mail<br></u></b>We looked at targeted direct mail to specific households in Milton as a way to reach families who are unaware or unfamiliar with Milton Girls Softball. To determine if it was a viable option, we mapped all the locations of the girls who registered in 2013.  The map is attached (NOTE: if you zoom in real close you can see Dana waving from his window!).  You can see some areas of town where Milton Girls Softball is not strongly represented.  We decided to look at a few of these areas but the direct mail cost is not worth the investment.  We decided that we are better off focusing on the efforts above.<br><br><u><b>Google Keywords<br></b></u>We are experimenting with Google Keywords.  Under a free promotion, we have purchased keywords so when someone in the Boston DMA (essentially metro Boston) searches for keywords on google.com that we define, an ad for Milton Girls Softball will appear.  We only pay when someone clicks on it at a cost of approximately 2¢ per click.  <br><br>When someone clicks the ad, we are directing them to a special page we have created.  The page is targeting this search audience with the assumption that they do not know much about Milton Girls Softball and would like to learn more.  Here is a link to the page:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=18958&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=18958&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br><br>We are testing various keywords, but here are some in the mix right now:<ul>
<li>milton girls softball</li>
<li>milton softball</li>
<li>milton ma softball</li>
<li>milton soccer (yes, we did)</li>
<li>milton lacrosse (yes, we did)</li>
<li>milton ma softball</li>
<li>milton travel softball</li>
</ul>Overall, there are about 30 keywords/phrases we are testing.  If you have some suggestions, feel free to share.  It's easy to add words. We will provide some initial findings at the Feb meeting.<br><br>The keywords should be running in the next day or two.<br><br><div>
<b><u>Ideas?</u></b><br>If you have other ideas about how to promote registration and the program as a whole, please share yours thoughts.  We are always looking to make it better.</div>

          As a continuation of our discussion on Registration, here are some numbers on the Freshwomen Division:<br><br><b>----------     2014*    ---------   2013  --------</b><br><b>K     </b>             13                          30<br><b>Grade 1 </b>     20                         42<br><b>Grade 2  </b>   29                          60<br>______________________________<br><div>
<b>Totals        62                         132<br><br></b>* as of 2/10/2014<br><br>As you can see, we are just under 50% from our total registrations in 2013. But what's interesting, it's that it's 50% across all ages. Kindergarten is not as under represented as we may have thought.<br><b><br></b>Also, someone asked about the size of last year's Grade 2.  It was on par with the other Grades.</div>

          Posted to Milton Neighbors the extended registration date. Glover PTO doesn't post this info on their FB page, will reach out to get onto Tucker edline but doesn't look like any other leagues are represented.

          Thanks Calece.  I was talking to Lloyd about it and you beat us to the punch.  Much appreciated.<br><br>For those of you who are new to the board, I did this registration analysis about a year ago.  It shows registrations over the past several years. Everything 2013 and earlier are actuals.  2014 and beyond are projections.<br><br>2012 was our registration high so it's unfair to expect that we would be able to sustain this number in 2014.<br><br>This past week got better as we now have 271 registrations and 79 in the Freshwomen Division.  The next two weeks are important so please continue to promote the program and registrations when you can.

          With registration winding down, I sent one last email to the league letting them know that registration closes on Friday, February 28th.  We are current at exactly 300 registrations.  I estimate a bump of another 5-10.  Definitely off from last year, but still very healthy.
