    I wanted to thank all the board members who took time out of their Sunday and helped out with the summer travel tryouts.  I thought it went smooth and the turnout was strong. <br><br>Thanks to Shawn, Ted, Lloyd and Brian.  And special thanks to Rich and Bill for staying for all four sessions. We also had great support from other coaches and parents including Pels, Ed Durfer, Laurie Jensen, Brian Mullaney, Eric Kelly, and Mike Kinsella.  If I missed someone, please let me know.<br><br>Thanks again everyone!

          New uniform consists of shirt, shorts, sliding shorts, socks and visor.<br><br>If you have a uniform from last year and not ordering a new uniform you will get a visor and socks. I just checked with vendor and we both don't think we gave out sliding shorts.<br><br>SuperFlash is working on our uniforms as I type this, I am going there today at 4pm to pick up everything that's done. If anything is outstanding I'll go there again tomorrow. They're working as fast as they can between all their orders and they have had a death in the family. My plan is to organize them by team later today and tonight. I will email the coaches asap when they are available and my plan is to bring them with me tomorrow to Championship day.<br><br>There were a few items back ordered (sliding shorts...ARGH!) and I won't get them until Monday. I just looked up and this is going to affect the U10 and both U12 teams, sorry! Monday is the best I'm going to be able to do and I'm going to have to wait until they call me and tell me they're in. I will go over there asap on Monday after I get the call. I will contact Maggie/Lloyd, Dana and Eric/Shawn on Monday asap when I have them in hand.<br><br>One last gotcha, there is one set of catcher's equipment that didn't come complete so one team will have to use their spring equipment until I can pick up the last summer catching equipment. I have no clue what team it is right now but will figure that out too later today.

          I know that we received sliding shorts last year, and before a parent went out and bought a new pair wanted to verify whether they get them as part of new uniform this year.<br>Let me know if you need any help picking up or doing a trip over.
