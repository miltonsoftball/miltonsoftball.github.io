          Interesting. If the north / south option provides more reasonable competitive opponents, the geography certainly helps.

          It's good to know that other teams struggling with this as well. Each of the ideas has some merit.  Would the Hock Board be willing to take this up for discussion at the next meeting?

          Yes it will be discussed and voted on in january will changes be made...not sure.  It does seem to be gaining some momentum I spoke to him last night on the phone he says that 5 towns are on board to make changes.  Still an up hill challenge..we shall see.

          If the Hock remains inflexible, Any thought of having the group all moving into the South Shore League.?  That would really form a solid north division with much easier commutes for all involved.

          Convenience and competitive balance were the resounding themes from parents.<br>If those towns peeled off to the SSnorth, it would be ideal<br>If the hock agreed to the dev option or the "north small" option that would also accomplish the goal

          I'm a little uneasy with option A. Although we might not  be currently competetive with the Frankins of the league, I'm not ready to resign us to being part of a "developmental league".
