    Well, it's not really a committee. There was some discussion at a recent board meeting about bathrooms. I reached out and received the following quote. I am advocating this either way - I am simply sharing information. I would like to understand from other board members if this is something we pursue and if so, where and what coordination would need to happen with Park &amp; Rec.<br><br>Here is the quote:<br><br><i>Hello Kevin, </i><br><br><i>Thank you for allowing me to update you about NSC Restrooms.  Your inquiry about preventing vandalism is a good one.  We do offer a $10.00 damage waiver, but it does not cover all vandalism, it does cover standard damage, broken locks, hand sanitizer, etc...  Major vandalism is not covered by the policy.  You can put a lock on the outside to keep the inside from being vandalized.  Tip overs are also not covered by the damage waiver.  Feel free to call the office to discuss.</i><br><br><i>Northeast Sanitation Corporation is a provider of portable restrooms and services for Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island. </i><br><br><i>Please note our competitive pricing which is always firm through completion of each project.</i><br><br><i>* Our monthly rate is $98.00 per month, which includes one cleaning per week for four weeks for each portable restroom (28-day cycle, industry standard). Taxes are $0.44 per cycle. </i><br><br><i>* There is a one time delivery fee of $10.00 per unit and insurance is optional at $10.00 per unit if elected. </i><br><br><i>* NSC does NOT charge for pick-up. There are NO fuel surcharges and there are NO environmental fees. </i><br><br><i>* A Winter Mix fee is charged from mid-November to mid-March, weather dependent, at $12.00 per month per unit. </i><br><br><div><i>We pride ourselves for our reliable and consistent service, availability (24/7), communication (phone, e-mail or text) and fixed pricing.</i></div><div>
<br><i>Please call us to schedule delivery of clean units to your projects! </i><br><br><i>Best regards, </i><br><br><i>Marie Long </i><br><i>Northeast Sanitation Corporation </i><br><i>3 Railroad Drive </i><br><i>Northborough, MA 01532 </i><br><a href="http://www.nscrestrooms.com/"><i>www.nscrestrooms.com</i></a><i> </i><br><br><i>Office: 508-351-9002 </i><br><i>Cell: +1 6177339982 </i><br><a><i>mlong@nscrestrooms.com</i></a>

          Having needed bathrooms for 2 games in a row I highly support this.<br>Starting May 1?<br><br>What kind of lock is on it- combination so we can give it to all the<br>coaches or is it by key? Who has a proposal for how to deal with getting<br>these locked?<br><br>Just to be clear on the costs, does this sound right?<br>2 months: May, June times 3 fields: Gile, Kelly, Andrews plus insurance and<br>delivery and pick up at each<br>2 * (98*3) * (10*3) + (10*3) + (10*3)<br>Total: $648 charged to spring<br><br>July<br>2 fields: Gile, Kelly (I have no idea what fields are used in summer)<br>1 * (98*2) = 196<br><br>For location if we put it right next to the house at Kelly I think it will<br>have less of a threat of being tipped over. At Andrews truthfully there's<br>not a great location - any ideas? I think we should get Milton Police input<br>on where they think good location would be. Would baseball be willing to<br>pay for the costs every other year at Andrews? Soccer? We can move ahead<br>without baseball's input but we should let the other leagues know how they<br>got there and we're up for sharing costs in subsequent years.

          If we are good with sharing this now, I'll forward on to Milton American where we have shared space for Andrews and Cunningham.  We have discussed and some of the Board work in construction as I knew they had numbers off the top of their head on cost.<br><br>Sent on the go

          I think we should get one at Kelley field this week to trial the fist location. Andrews and Kelley seemed to be the greatest need and we can grow into more than one location, once we see how it works at Kelley.  I think once we start one, the other community sports will pitch in (soccer, baseball, etc) with cost, if its operating as we had hoped.  <br><br>3 mths at Kelley would be a good start. (after July, we are off the fields)

          Yes - this is part of the Milton American PO. One at Andrews, Kelly and Mary C. Lane. It's less than $100 per month (including weekly cleaning and insurance) and will charge us for Kelly and we can alternate on Andrews. We had a board member in construction who was able to help us with pricing.<br><br>I will get exact $ number for next meeting.
