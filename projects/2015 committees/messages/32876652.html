    Hi Calece and Lloyd,<br><br>Thanks for your time on Monday and your thoughts on the Freshwomen program. As a follow-up, I think we agreed that Lloyd was going to find out more info about baseballs 4/5 year old program. Calece was going to poll the Freshwoman coaches on their thoughts about K participating in the Fresh league vs. a separate prek/K program. Â I think a small committee would be great to continue the discussion. Are both of you interested in participating?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kevin

          I'm interested and have searched some other sites to see what they do in those age categories.   Pat Ryan is the Tee Ball name and now waiting for contact info.

          I just emailed the coaches asking for feedback asap. Not a lot of info on the baseball leagues websites to see exactly how they structured their clinics. So we'll need a lot more info if we move ahead with this. Interested to hear from more coaches on what they are thinking. Sorry took so long!
