          5 applications were received and essays sent to Shawn yesterday. Committee is meeting tonight. I have the originals. <br><br>Below is the process outlined for approving the recipients. Let me know when you need their contact info. <br><br><p>1.    Tally votes and determine winners. The
goal is the most amount of points.</p>

<p>a.    If there is a 1st place
winner and a 2nd place winner then those are the two winners.</p>

<p>b.    If there is a tie for 1st
place those two winners are the winners of the two scholarships.</p>

<p>c.    If there is a 1st place
winner and there is a tie for 2nd place then the Executive Board of
Directors reviews those two essays and votes on the winner.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Approval Process</b></p><p>1.    The Executive Board member presents
the findings to the remaining two members.</p><p>2.    If there are any questions then the
Review Committee has to meet to discuss. If there are no questions then the two
scholarship recipients are contacted.</p><p>3.    The schools will be notified and the
awards will be given to the schools for presentation at the schools award
ceremony.</p>

          <p><br>We need one quote per winner so I'll need to know if this quote is from #2 or #4. Then I'll need another quote.</p><p><br></p><p>After the winners are announced at the award ceremony we will get a photo of each winner and then send an announcement to the Milton Times as well as post it on our website.</p>

          Was able to hand out the scholarships to two deserving Milton high school seniors last night.  Great time.  I also want to recognize Karen for putting together a certificate/t-shirt package (along with their scholarship award) - and for delivering said packages to my house.  Thanks Karen!
