  <div class="content">
    We should start thinking about a date/time for equipment drop off.<br><br>Freshwomen end the season this Sunday, 6/7 (10 teams).<br><br>The rest of the league have playoffs next week (half the teams will be eliminated by EOD Sunday, 6/7 weather permitting).<br><br>We could do it in two waves or we can do one date like last year.<br><br>I am open to whatever the Equipment Committee would like to do.  I am happy to help out.

          Actually, I am wrong.  The Fresh have games on 6/13. <br><br>So we should select one date during the week of 6/13.

          Checklist for Equipment Drop-off Attached. <br><br>Please note I included the K Program (figured they could come to Extra Space Storage right after the K program ends) as well as Summer Coaches who need to pick up a summer bag.
