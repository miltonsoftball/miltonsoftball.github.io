  <div class="content">
    Per last night's meeting I did a breakdown of what we did for pitching clinics in 2014. I forget the number of sessions for the armory and Kelly field which would be helpful to add here. The private clinics with Janelle was paid for mostly by the players. The league covered a couple hundred of the cost. <br><br>Others were following up on different pieces of this project so I figured I'd start a thread others can add to.
