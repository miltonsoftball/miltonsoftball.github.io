    First  night of clinics at Dirt Dawgs tonight. Freshwomen division had 17 attendees, and Junior division had 23. We would have liked more participants, but it went well. Thanks to Brian Mullaney for coming down early and helping out. I will discuss at meeting.

          I'm going to be away this coming Sunday and looking for somebody to sign in girls at the clinics this week. Need to be there for sign in at about 4:45 for Freshwomem and 6:30 for Junior. I usually stay but not required, so can leave around 7. Thanks.
