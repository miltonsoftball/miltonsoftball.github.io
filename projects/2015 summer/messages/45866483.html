    A quick shoutout to the board about the summer travel teams. We had 6 travel teams this summer and 4 of them made the playoffs. In addition, two of the 4 teams won their respective championships: U10 Mullaney and U18.  <br><br>In case you missed it, the website more information about the playoffs:<br>U10: <a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://miltonsoftball.com/#374884" target="_blank">http://miltonsoftball.com/#374884</a><br>U18: <a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://miltonsoftball.com/#374889" target="_blank">http://miltonsoftball.com/#374889</a><br><br>We will be collecting feedback but I think overall I think the summer was a success.<br><br>Great job coaches.

          Congrats to Brian and Kevin.  A very enjoyable Summer season it looks like all teams were competitive.   Moving forward I wouldn't be surprised to see our summer numbers increase next year because of it.

          Great summer season. Thanks to all the coaches who devoted their time. As we know, it's only 5-6 weeks, but a huge time commitment to get to all the games and practices. We competed well and can probably think about advancing to Elite whenever possible next year.
