    <h2>Summer Budget</h1>

  <div class="content">
    Hi all,<br><br>I spent time with our summer budget and reviewed it with Karen and Bill. As you know, we want the summer program to be self-sufficient. After including every possible expense we could think of, we essentially have about $900 in discretionary spending.<br><br>In evaluating the ideas and options presented (catcher's mitt, clinics, subsidize tourney fees, etc.), we decided that the best use of the $900 would be to have each summer team attend a Dirt Dawg hitting clinic.  Bill is working on the logistics but we plan to have this in place immediately so teams can schedule a DD session over the next week or two.<br><br>The summer budget is attached if you are curious how the budget breaks out.<br><br>If you have any questions or ideas that we should consider for next summer (i.e. raise the summer fee and include a tournament), we would love to hear them.<br><br>Thanks!

          Summer Coaches, we've arranged a team hitting clinic at Dirt Dawgs for each team. Call them directly to schedule at 781-562-0758. Ask for Don or TJ. They have your names of head coach. Try to do so next week or so if possible to help at beginning of season a week from Monday. Good Luck!
