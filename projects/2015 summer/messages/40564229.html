          Hi all,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback. Ideally, we would like AT LEAST 7 people per session. 1 checkin, 3 running drills and 3 doing evaluations.  A summer coach should not evaluate their own age group (but they can do drills).<br><br>I have put together the following document:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/a/miltonsoftball.com/spreadsheets/d/1T9R7162gfnzjRdndrsaQ7dfpmO038BUo8Vlo6Hbj_hQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/a/miltonsoftball.com/spreadsheets/d/1T9R7162gfnzjRdndrsaQ7dfpmO038BUo8Vlo6Hbj_hQ/edit?usp=sharing</a><br><br><b>You can edit it so feel free to update.</b><br><br>For those of you who have responded, please check the schedule to make sure it's still accurate.<br><br>For those of you who have not responded but can help out, please add your name where you can.<br><br>Thanks!

          Hi all -<br><br>The updated schedule is here:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/a/miltonsoftball.com/spreadsheets/d/1T9R7162gfnzjRdndrsaQ7dfpmO038BUo8Vlo6Hbj_hQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/a/miltonsoftball.com/spreadsheets/d/1T9R7162gfnzjRdndrsaQ7dfpmO038BUo8Vlo6Hbj_hQ/edit#gid=0</a><br><br>A lot goes into tryouts to make sure it's a fair and well run evaluation. We are still shorthanded for several of the sessions. Having AT LEAST 6 coaches/adults at each session is important for a successful tryout.<br><br>Please review the attached and if your schedule has changed, let me know. Also, if you know of any coaches who would like to help out, we can certainly use the help.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kevin
