    Freshwomen Coach Sally Driscoll reached out to us a few weeks back about having a fun, laid back series of softball games for the K Program and Freshwomen Division. She wanted to provide the girls an opportunity to keep playing during the summer as well as prepare rising 3rd graders for the next level. <br><br>As a trial, she is running 3 Softball Summer Jams. 90 minutes of softball each Thursday at Cunningham Park. She has recruited several Coaches as well as our own Gary Kelly!  She has the board's full support.<br><br>It will be a great experience for the girls and if it gains traction it may be something we can establish more formally next summer.<br><br>The info is on the website, twitter, facebook and an email was sent out to the K-2 parents/players.<br><br><div>***************************<br><br><br>
