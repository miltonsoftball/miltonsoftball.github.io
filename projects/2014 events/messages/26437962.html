    Hi everyone!<br><br>I created a single link that I think will be a handy reference for the events on Saturday. It has all of our contact info as well as a list of <b>who is bringing what </b><u>AND</u> <b>when people are assigned to work.</b>  <br><br>Please review it and let me know if anything needs to change.  If you can commit to additional time, let me know.  We can always use the help.  If you can recruit other volunteers, please do so and let me know.  <br><br>Works on your mobile too!<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17007308/2014_all-star_saturday.html" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17007308/2014_all-star_saturday.html</a>
