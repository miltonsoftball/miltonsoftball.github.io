          Ted...what type of help do you need before Saturday? and Saturday during the day? We should start updating the list and make sure everything is all set. LMK what I can do to help pre-Sat. and I'll be there in the late afternoon and evening.

          Happy to lend a hand, out of pocket till Thursday.  I can touch base with Pats then, if its not to late, or if no one has been assigned.  Spoke with Ted on grills, which we can use the grill at Brooks field.

Please sign up for the slots where you can volunteer.  The plan is to serve food in two waves... 2-4 and then from 5:30-7:30.  This way we can hit every age division.

          I can bring ice for the first wave 2pm cook? (will bring 20lbs? or 40lbs since we have enough coolers), Cooler, propane, a table, and grilling utensils (and fire starter).  I can meet Pat's at noon, and help set up grilling and serving area.
