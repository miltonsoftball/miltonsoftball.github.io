          <p><b>I have been in
contact with Michelle Hirsch who is handling the Little League parade.  They are having a cookout on the lower fields
and logistically other then marching in together I do not see a way to combine
the two since we will be on the upper field.  In the future maybe it is
something that possibly could work.  She
is handling contacting the PD and FD and I will coordinate with her for the lining up of the teams.  </b></p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>Opening day is fast approaching I am open to any thoughts
on who could throw out the first pitch but have a few myself.  How about someone
associated or directly affected or affiliated with the marathon bombings.  Does anyone know of anyone with ties to Milton?  Opening day is just a few days after the one year
anniversary.  I know Josh Nemzer who
works for the BAA lives in Milton I am not sure if his daughter played MGSL.  Last year we recognized a Milton
firefighter who has kids in the MGSL who served in Iraq.  Is there a Milton police officer in the same position or
another Town employee?  </b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>I am working on the timeline, volunteer list, what we need to bring, etc. I will post early next week</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Ted</b></p>

          I have attached the timeline.  Does anyone have any thoughts on throwing out the first pitch?  Gary, have you confirmed Pauline Wells?  I used the Milton HS Choir for a few wrestling events this year they did a great job if you haven't confirmed her I will see if I can get them.  Let me know.  We will be in good shape as long as we get the volunteers and the "items to bring", tents, coolers, tables, sound system etc.  <br><br>I can contact Pats for the pizza order but thought that whoever signed them on as a sponsor probably should, Nick/Sean just to show good faith.<br><br>If everyone could respond to this thread and I will keep track .

          Brian - any chance you can get the championship trophy back from the A's? We can also ask Mark if he'd like to be there. It may be with Mark unless he passed it on to his assistant.  We will need it for Opening Day.  Thanks.

          Just had a thought on throwing out pitch- there's a Milton Police woman who<br>grew up in Milton (I lifeguarded with her). She *may *have played softball.<br>Name's Beth (?). I'm sure Chief Wells could let you know. She's been a cop<br>for a while so sure she was involved in extra helping last year somehow<br>around the marathon.<br><br>Just a thought- no pressure.

          Can everyone please wear their black MGS polo the day of the parade? If it's cool I am sure we'll all have something on over it but if the weather is nice it would be great for us all to be visible. Thanks!

          Spoke to my players mother, Leah about throwing out the first pitch and she agreed to do it. We have her aunt as the contact, Erin, as she takes care of Lily in her absence. She just got back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, where she worked as a hospital coreman in  the Navy and is stationed back here for a while.

          Hi all -<br><br>After much conversation with Ted, Karen, Bill and myself, we have decided not to reschedule the parade for this year.  Scheduling, town events and an uncertain weather forecast all played a factor.<br><br><p>With the season heading into May, we believe that town activities as well as First Communions present scheduling challenges for many parents and players. Saturday's games will remain as scheduled. </p><p><br></p><p>We will be sending out a communication to the entire league soon.</p>
