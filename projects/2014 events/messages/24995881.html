    <h2>Senior Division play up coordinator position</h1>

  <div class="content">
    Circling back to our last board meeting , thought was raised of offering somebody a paid part time position of being coordinator of agent (play-up) program. There is concern that with limited rosters( two teams especially with 11 right now) that some senior games will be challenged. Person would have to be available from 3-6pm  and receive and make necessary calls to fill spots from a pool of interested junior players. No details yet, just an idea , but please share your thoughts?
