    Calece -<br><br>I figured we could use this to kickoff the discussion. We can also talk or meet as we dig into the details.<br><br><ul>
<li>
<b>Name</b>:  Freshwomen Skills Challenge - does it change?</li>
<li>
<b>Events</b>:  This is what we had in place last year (see two docs attached).</li>
<li>
<b>Giveaway</b>: Last year we had ice cream or popsicles (I forget).  We also had medals.  Maybe t-shirts this year.</li>
<li>Help: ask fresh coaches to attend for water balloons.  Senior div girls to volunteer by being honory captains and also running stations.  Sign in table and PA for music/announcements.</li>
</ul><br>Let's start brainstorming. :)<br><br>Kevin

          This is great. Can you think of an event that the girls can use their gloves? Looking to incorporate a little more 'softball'. Not sure on name- I'm sure there's a better one. Let's think and I'll ask around. I'd like for coaches to RSVP and if they can't make it tell us an assistant who can for water balloons to ensure each girl gets a chance. I'll also ask if they have any input for the day.<br><br>I would say a Popsicle is great. <br><br>Do we have a rain date plan? <br><br>Do girls go to stations with their teams? Or should we mix them up? <br><br>T-shirts would be fun as an award. Coaches can take the extra ones for their other players with them if we want to ensure every player gets it.

          I called SuperFlash yesterday and have information for the t-shirts. Approx. cost for a white t-shirt with 1 color is @$6 per shirt.<br><br>If we want to use Janelle's logo (see attached, I am not sure if this is her logo or not but found it on her Sting website) then we'll have to get a better price from Chuck. If we want to use a different color shirt that will increase the price as well. We are using neon shirts for the Soph., Jr., and Sr. so we could find a 4th neon color to use.<br><br>What about using the artwork that the Soph., Jr., and Sr. girls will have for the front of the shirt and then use Janelle's logo on the back of the shirt? See attached the shirts from last year as well as the artwork for this year.<br><br>LMK what you want to do and the sooner I have the order for Chuck the better.

          I like the idea of a neon shirt. Milton Logo left breast pocket on front.<br>Janelle's info on the back- but she would have to give input on what she<br>wants if she's paying. Kevin can you reach out to her?

          The logo on the front is big across the chest, I would leave it that way so that it's consistent across all the divisions. I think the shirts that we sell should be that way, I'll post that information now.

          I agree on Neon with the Freshwomen but I would make sure it's a different color than the other three divisions AND that all neon colors will work with our all black logo.<br><br>Adding the East Coast Pitching logo to the back will be an added cost. Maybe we can stay consistent and just have the letters "East Coast Pitching" on the back like the team sponsors.  I would like to avoid sponsors complaining that one sponsor had a logo and the others didn't.<br><br>I think we need to start publicizing this event to the Freshwomen.  It's been on their schedule and on the website but it's not enough. <br><br><b>Calece</b>- Can you help with the messaging to the division?  This is what we sent last year:<br><br><p><i>Join your teammates for some fun and excitement as you take part in the Freshwomen Skills Challenege.  This event is open to all girls in the Freshwomen Division (Kindergarten through 2nd Grade).  </i></p><p><br></p><p><i>Make sure you wear your uniform and bring your smile!</i></p><p><br></p><p><b><i>When: Saturday, June 1, 2013</i></b></p><p><b><i>Time: 12:30p - 1:30p</i></b></p><p><b><i>Where: Gile Field (at the high school)</i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>We also had this page with more info (we need to update it):</p><p><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://miltonsoftball.com/Page.asp?n=50328&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">http://miltonsoftball.com/Page.asp?n=50328&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p>

          We are getting T-shirts for the Fresh girls.  Karen is ordering them.<br><br>I am open to suggestions for a rain date.  What do you think?<br><br>What do you mean by "update the website under teams?"

          That's great about tshirts.<br>Is there a rain date for the all star games? We could do the freshwomen the<br>next weekend at Andrews but wouldn't work for other divisions.<br>When you click on 'teams' on the website there's a 'freshwomen skills<br>challenge' link. It needs to be updated.<br><br>I will send out the blast today to all players/parents.
