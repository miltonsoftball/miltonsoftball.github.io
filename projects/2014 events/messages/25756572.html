    Calece<br>I contacted SuperFlash if we use white or black shirts with the logo in the upper left front of the t-shirt the cost @$6 each for a quantity of 100. He can use a different color shirt and different quantities but it will affect the cost (within a $1 or so each). The logo looks great on the black shirt but you have younger kids, will they wear black or should we stick to white? I love the idea of a red shirt but the logo will not look good, we looked at that when we were ordering the coaches shirts. I think black or white is your best bet. What do you think?

          I think they're very nice! I think black's fine- something different and<br>parents might thank us for something that won't get as dirty.

          Ok I will order today, how many do we want to get and what sizes? I think we should get adult and children's shirts. I just spoke with Chuck and here are the sizes. (He said not to get youth S they're really small and because they're all cotton they will shrink a bit. He also said that they Youth XL and Adult S are almost the same size so I took Youth XL off the list.)<br><br>Youth M (10-12 but 6, 7 and 8 year old)<br>Youth L (9-11 year old)<br>Adult S (12-14 year old)<br>Adult M<br>Adult L<br>Adult XL<br>Adult XXL<br>Adult XXXL<br><br>One last thing, we need to come up with the pricing but I would like to see what the final cost is because the larger adult shirts will cost a little bit more. Do you think we should charge one price? I think it will be a lot easier to deal with if we do.
