  <div class="content">
    We have Championship Saturday scheduled for Saturday, June 14th.  The schedule is as follows:<br><ul>
<li>Sophomore - 2:30 pm</li>
<li>Junior - 5 pm</li>
<li>Senior - 7:30 pm</li>
</ul><br>The event is not as involved as the All-Star Game but we still need have a few things to manage. We are looking for volunteers to help with certain aspects of the games.<br><br>Hopefully as a coach you will be involved in the game itself, so if you can help out with one of the others games it would be much appreciated.<br><br>Gary is looking into the viability of having the fence repaired in time for Saturday.<br><br>Do we sell shirts?  Does someone want to take ownership of it and recruit volunteers to help set up and sell at a table?<br><br><b>Please click on the following link and assign yourself to specific tasks:</b><br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tZqYNQJCUPIkk7OlfqyILMvm2UCUV0NxGMKZusLpns/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tZqYNQJCUPIkk7OlfqyILMvm2UCUV0NxGMKZusLpns/edit?usp=sharing</a> <br><br>Thanks!

          All... I may not be able to make the Sr game (hoping there is enough coverage).  Please let me know if this puts us in a bind.  One of our sophomore coaches, Tim Allen, gets in at 8pm from a two week national guard tour in Alaska.  We are having the team over for a cookout after the sophomore game - and his wife just asked if we can keep team together until he makes it back from airport.  I can't do this if i am going to help with Senior game...  Is there enough coverage for me to skip senior game? Sorry to burden anyone - I will be there if 100% needed.<br><br>Let me know.
