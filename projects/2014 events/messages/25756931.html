          If ordering new tents, I would recommend to replace Bill Vaughn's tent as well, which was broken at the All Star game.  Bill's tent was of higher grade metal, bigger (not the 10x 10), it would be nice to replace with similar/same model. (I also know his cooler was broken, large white igloo)
