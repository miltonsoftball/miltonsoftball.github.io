          Hey all.  Sorry for the short notice, but I will not be able to attend the board meeting.  I will be away skiing in New Hampshire for the week.  <br><br>If interested I am happy to take the lead on Kens fund raising tasks.  No one person will be able to replace all he has done, but happy to do all I can.
