          Sorry. Reading backward seeing it starts at 7:30. Should we move it to 8 or leave as is?

          We are starting at 7:30pm because the kitchen closes at 8pm and I want to make sure we have an order in before they close the kitchen. I'll be there at 7:30pm so no worries everyone please come late.<br><br>The only person thus far that cannot come is Calece.

          Hi all -<br>We understand that several of you have games so this is why we scheduled the meeting for later than usual.<br><br>The meeting will be light and more conversational.  We can reflect on the Spring season along with some food and drink.  <br><br>Please swing by The View whenever you can.
