          Attached you fill find the summary of where we stand for the league. In the bank we have: $38,225. Look at the 'spring' balance when planning what we have to spend for the rest of the season without having to tap into any sponsorship monies: $4,415. <br><br>In the off season I plan to do the yearly comparisons of how much we carry over per year so we can plan out any capital expenditure planning. Also the move to 501c3 status is on hold until I have more time when school and the season is done. <br><br>These are the treasurer updates so unless folks want to discuss something we don't need time on the agenda for this. I will have a few copies of this summary for the meeting. If you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to bring them forward. <br><br>Thank you. Calece
