    Good news all around. Last night was a success on both fronts. At Collicot, all three pitching clinics were filled to maximum. At the same time we had about 60 girls attend skills clinics at Cunningham. Many thanks to all the board members who attended and helped out. Special thanks to Brian M who was there throughout and took the equipment back. Also thanks to Mike Kinsella who donated his time to us. We have these for the next two Monday's 2/29 and 3/7 from 6-9. On 3/14 we will be having a coaches clinic there to instruct coaches on best practices. For those of you who would like to help out next two weeks, please respond to this thread with your availability. Thanks

          I've planned to be at all of the Monday clinics coming up for the duration of them each night.Â  Can transport any equipment for anyone if I know what and where too.

          Another good night for skills clinic, as we followed up the skills portion with a couple of full court scrimmages that the girls really seemed to enjoy. Thanks again to all the board members who helped out, and special thanks to Gary and Bill G who stayed the entire 3 hours, which is a long stretch of continuous instruction. Last one is next Monday for skills and once again participation is welcome. The following Monday the 14th we are having a coaches clinic. Mike Kinsella and Gary will be addressing Fresh and Spoh coaches on best practices from 6-7pm, and MHS coach Ed Amico will be speaking to Jr and Sr coaches from 7-8. His goal is to relay his vision of best practices and skill building to get the girls prepared to play HS ball.
