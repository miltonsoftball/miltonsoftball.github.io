    Hi all -<br><br>We kicked off our latest session of pitching clinics last night and the feedback was positive.<br><br>As a reminder, we scheduled Janelle for two sessions at 5pm and 6pm for 4 weeks each. We also hired Alexa D'Onofrio to run two additional sessions at the same timed/different field. Alexa is the pitching coach at ENC.<br><br>The clinics nearly sold out with only one slot open for Alexa's 6pm session. <br><br><div>I observed Alexa's sessions for 10-15 minutes each. She is very personable, connected with the girls, and they were engaged. This was particularly the case with the first group where we had 6 girls who had never pitched before.<br><br>Good stuff.</div>

          Agree.  Went to the clinic Monday night with Alexa - figured my daughter needed a tune-up and after 2 seasons of the clinics with Janelle (whom I rate highly) I took convenience of Cunningham for myself and get some feedback.<div><br></div><div>- approach...she does very similar in starting small, flips, then T and then K stretch with step etc.</div><div>- style ... moves up and down the lines, recognizes where each kid is at</div><div>- personality ... connects with the girls very well, much like Janelle and explains things in nice, simple terms</div><div><br></div><div>Definitely a great addition, she is looking for FT teaching role so could be repeat season after season.  In lieu of not being able to work on private lesson with Janelle with scheduling...my daughter and I liked Alexa enough we will do lessons for her outside the clinics too.</div>
