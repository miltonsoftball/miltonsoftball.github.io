    Bill has confirmed our pitching clinic dates with Janelle and Collicot/Cunningham. They are:<br><ul>
<li>2/22</li>
<li>2/29</li>
<li>3/7</li>
<li>3/14</li>
</ul>We will have the lessons in the Collicot gym from 6-9pm. We also have the Cunningham Gym on these dates/times. Any suggestions on what we should use it for? Some ideas include: catcher's clinic, coaches clinic, basic pitching. Anything else you can think of.<br><br>It's a great opportunity to take of advantage of indoor space during the winter months. We would love your thoughts and feedback.

          I think you meant 2/29...<br><br>This is great news. I think we'd have to break up the 3 hours into younger<br>and older age groups but could potentially concentrate on similar skills.<br>It would be great to have one with the high school team (unless that's<br>happening somewhere else). As a coach I'd be willing to help organize one<br>session but I would think we'd need multiple volunteers per session. I'd<br>only charge for these if we get a professional to come in. The high school<br>session could be a fundraiser for them.

          Stations, one session a focus on defense Infield drills, outfield drills, catching drills.  Another session on hitting, off the tee, soft toss etc.  We could mix it up. I am available to help.

          I am in the process of coordinating with my husband's schedule to be available to support a station at the clinic.  Abbie will be pitching at the 6:00 beginner session (this is her first time with Janelle) so I will be available after then.  <br><br>On another note, is there a Dirt Dawgs session tonight?  I reviewed the auto-email from Junior registration and tonight is not a listed date. See below:<br><br>Congratulations!<br>As an early registrant who is paid in full, you are eligible to attend our Pre-Season Clinics. The Pre-Season Clinics will be at Dirt Dawgs from 6:30 to 8PM on the following Sundays:<br>- Jan 24th<br><br>- Jan 31st<br><br>- Feb 21st<br><br>- Feb 28th<br><br>- Mar 13th<br><br>- Mar 20th<br><br>- Apr 10th

          Tonight is freshwomen and then sophomore. Jr/Sr not tonight. Also, to clarify, any help would not be needed at the pitching clinics but rather next door at "Spring Training". Thanks.
