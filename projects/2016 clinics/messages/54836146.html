  <div class="content">
    Due to the overwhelming response to our Sunday clinics as Dirt Dawgs, we need to separate the Junior and Senior groups into their own sessions. This will require our clinic schedule to be adjusted to accommodate all four groups. Bill has crafted the email below and we will be sending it out to the league tonight.<br><br>We want you to share this information with you in advance.<br><br><div><i><b>"Due to an increased level of participation at Dirt Dawgs, we are altering our present Sunday schedule. The new schedule will allow each division to enjoy more space and increased personal attention. The updated schedule is posted on our website and will be reflected in notification messages. We hope that you are enjoying the preseason clinics as we approach the Spring season."</b></i></div>
