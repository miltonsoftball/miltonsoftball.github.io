          Would it be possible for someone to pull together a press release for this. Maybe include a few quotes?  It would be great to get photos of each if possible. I'd like to add it to the website but we can also ask Lloyd to send it out to the Times, Patch, Wicked Local, Facebook and Twitter.  <br><br>Also, I see a word doc with title "Did not win letter."  Did we reach out to the girls who did not win last year?  If so, will we do it this year?

          I will write up the press release and have it ready for mid week next week. I will get it to Lloyd and ask him to get it to The Times, Patch, Wicked Local. I'll get it to you for Facebook and Twitter and the MGS website. MHS award night is Tues. so I will call the girls on Wed. and ask for a photo of them playing softball and include those with the press release.<br><br>We wrote the letter last year but we dropped the ball and never created them. What do you think, should we just call them or send a letter or do both?
