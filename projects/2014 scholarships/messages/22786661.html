          Ted, I cannot find the email but I know it was not from Margaret Gibbons. She was the contact person from last year. Let me look through my emails again and try to find the contact person from MHS. I'll be back in touch with you.

          I found the email and sent it to you as well as wecare email account.<br><br>Here is the process document and all the forms I created last year. I edited them and changed them to be generic for this y ear. I updated the date for this year to be May 3, 2014 the 1st Saturday of May (same as last year). We can change the date if necessary.<br><br>Ted...let Shawn and I know when you want to meet to start working on this. I think we should notify the schools asap because we're down to 6 1/2 weeks until May 3rd.<br><br>Bill...we're going to need you to be the Exec BOD member to help keep the names confidential. Kevin's daughter is a senior and eligible and I am on the committee.

          I need to contact the guidance dept at Milton High today regarding a Fallon scholarship so can also talk to them about MGSL scholarship.  I will send them the appropriate documents.

          I agree about Bill being involved.  <br><br>As a side note, Rebecca and I agreed that she will not be applying for the scholarship.  Despite the great efforts and protocols put in place by the scholarship committee, I think it's cleaner and in the best interest of both parties.

          Ted and I spoke last night and he's going to contact all the schools today and send the applications.<br><br>Ted...do you want me to update the press release and ask Lloyd to sent it out (or I can send it as well)? LMK<br><br>Bill...can you start to monitor the PO Box and keep track of the applications? No rush because we posted the deadline as Sat., 5/3.

          Sure, but Calece checks the PO box every Friday right now. Will the letters there be addressed differently so I can get them from her ?

          Ted...I will do this today and talk to Llyod, thanks!<br><br>Bill...If you could have Calece pick them up and then give you the envelopes that would be great. You can hold onto them for now and as we get closer I'll need you to help us organize them. The people on the committee should not see the names. <br><br>Last year Kevin took all the essays and photocopied them and kept the originals separate. He then took the copies and numbered them and then put white out over the names. I received 3 copies of the whited out essays for the committee to review. So the only identifier is the number on all the pages. As for the applications, I'll need you to review them and make sure that they are filled out correctly and that the girls qualify to apply for the scholarship. Last year we awarded 2 applications and I think we had 6 applications total.

          Sure. Only question I have is how will Calece know they are scholarship related and not just a late registration check or something? Does it matter of she sees the contents?

          The only thing I need Calece to do is save the envelopes. She can feel free to open all the mail and it's not a problem at all for her to see anything. The envelope should contain a one page application and a one page essay, that's it!
