  <div class="content">
    I messaged all the freshman coaches asking them to bring water balloons - hopefully they comply. <div><br></div><div>Brian, can you bring your boat cooler so I can put the popsicles in it? I'll grab a couple bags of ice too. <div><br></div>
<div>Do you think we need to be there any earlier than 12:30pm? I have the banner too so know that will need to be set up. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Should we hand out tshirts at the end or beginning? </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Kevin was asking a few players to help out- Brian you have a few too? We def need them since we have the K players with no coaches.</div>
</div><div><br></div><div>I bought red solo cups - knocking them off the table works well only if there's no wind. I have some tennis balls- if others have them please bring. Or we can use some of the plastic balls. </div><div><br></div><div>Kevin is Gary authorized to set up the hose again? Or should I email him? High of 84 - hose will come in handy.</div>

          I will bring boat cooler. Will have at least one, probably 2 or 3 Astros to help. 1230 should be fine. Do you have zip ties?<br>I would give kids shirts at the beginning-<br><br>Anything else you need me to bring ?<br><br>Brian Mullaney<br>Sent from my iPhone

          I would suggest no later than 12:30. We need to also put the sponsor banners up. We also told the K/Fresh to get there 10 mins early for checkin. Adding in that there needs to be some orientation to the helpers you need the time.<br><br>Girls are wearing their team shirts and it's a good way to group them (by team). I would suggest tshirts at the end when we hand out the popsicles. One less thing for them to carry/lose.<br><br>I am not sure about the hose. I would definitely check with Gary.

          Kevin I assume you'll have zip ties for banners. Gary said he has set up our use of the hose. <br><br>Can someone else please grab 120 popsicles at least 1 box of sugar free? Just occurred to me that my game 9-11 on Saturday is AT Gile so I'll have enough time to run home to drop off daughter...and I can easily be at Gile at 12:15.
