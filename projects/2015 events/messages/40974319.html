          I can bring 2 large tables, 1 large boat cooler, 1 tent. Laureen has volunteered to help with concessions as well. I can also bring a banner we have at Dirt a Dawgs. Do we need tie wraps also?

          Here is what I have tomorrow:<br><br>I am bringing 225 popsicles/ice cream cups in a cooler.  Will drop off at field at 11:30 and then meet my team before the parade.  Once we march to field I will stick around and volunteer (pick up trash, hand out ice cream whatever is needed).  Let me know if there is any other specific tasks still open -- happy to do more.  <br><br>Should be a great day!

          Thanks everyone for all your help with the parade. I think it went very well. Bill - please thank Laureen and Ashley for their help as well.<br><br><b><u>Notes for 2016</u></b><br>Weather was in the 50s and sunny.<br><br>I think we had about 200-220 girls attend. We had 35 pizzas and I think a few of us felt we could have sold another 10.  <br><br>We had several left over cases of water and plenty of extra ice. We had 5 40lb bags and we probably only needed 3.
