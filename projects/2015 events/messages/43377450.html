    Here is the volunteer signup page for Championship Saturday.<br><br>It would be great if you can commit to a couple hours. We have 2 volunteers for each bucket (field prep, game operations, etc.) for each division. If we each do a bucket or two, it will not consume your Saturday :)<br><br>Please take a look and add your name where you can.<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkC-sJq6wg3wLaphs5uIJC4VGW0pQPE9fGO2SHuxEKk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkC-sJq6wg3wLaphs5uIJC4VGW0pQPE9fGO2SHuxEKk/edit#gid=0</a><br><br>Thanks!
