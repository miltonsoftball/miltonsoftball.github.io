    I typed up my notes from last night because I want to keep the file on BC. Two things:<br><p><br></p><p>The library is booked for all of our requested dates and the entire 2 weeks we are looking at! Should I call Cunningham? LMK your thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>I forgot to discuss our Thank you event at The View. They contacted me asking about a date for this year. Right now we have it tentatively scheduled for Wed., 6/17 are we still ok with that date. Do we know if they are definitely going to be a sponsor this year or should I contact Nick? LMK<br></p>

          I think we need to use Cunningham. Date is fine with me. Is that week between dori g and Summer. If so even better

          Let me brainstorm on a location for the meetings. Cunnigham has no wifi, no projection screen and it's loud and echoes.<br><br>In terms of the Thank You, the date is great.

          Any ideas on meetings? How about we squeeze one group in from 6-7 on the 19th before our Board meeting. That should be available and we are already there.

          Let's see if Cunningham is available. I tried St. Agatha's and Fontbonne but didn't have any luck.<br><br>I would prefer not to combine it on the same day as the board meeting.  We have a lot to cover in the board meeting and will need the time.

          Doesn't board meeting start at 7 though? I figured 6-7 would work but if you think it's too jammed I get it.

          Yeah, I was thinking it would be too hectic but you are right, let's do it.<br><br>I emailed Brian asking if we can get the library from 6-7. If we can, let's plan on having the Juniors during this time slot. Small group, several returning coaches.
