    Hi Bill/Karen,<br><br>I was wondering when you would like to meet again. It could be in person or it could be a call. Topics on the list include:<br><ul>
<li>2015 Registration Feeds</li>
<li>Summer Travel (not pressing but something we should address soon)</li>
</ul><br>Based on Calece's report, I feel we are undercharging. For the Soph, Junior, Senior we are covering our costs but do not have much wiggle room to support the program in an on-going basis. I think we cannot expect the Sponsorship revenue to fund Spring. I feel that any revenue from sponsorship or from fundraising should go toward larger initiatives such as new fields, scoreboards, etc.<br><br>I'd love to talk about it with both of you and hear your thoughts.  Let me know if you think a call or in person meeting works best and when we should meet.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Kevin

          If this week maybe a call is best? Tuesday is out and can probably work a time on other days.
