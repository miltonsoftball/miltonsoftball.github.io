    The playoff schedule is posted on the website under the master calendar.  I'd love another set of eyes to review it.  You can also compare it with an update page on the website that I plan on sending our to the league.<br><br>Playoffs start on Sunday, June 7th with the Sophomore and Juniors.  Gile is closed due to graduation.<br><br><b>Sophomore Playoffs</b><br>Sunday (Monday rain date)<br>Winners play Thursday (their normal game date during week)<br>Championship on Sat<br><br><b>Junior Playoffs</b><br>Sunday (Rain date Tue/Wed - one game each day)<br>Winners play Tuesday (their normal game date during week, if no rain)<br>Championship on Sat<br><br><b>Senior Playoffs</b><br>Play Wed (their normal game date during week) - no CP due to men's league<br>Championship on Sat<br><br>Please compare what is on the master schedule:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://leagueathletics.com/MasterGameSchedule.asp?n=59705&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">https://leagueathletics.com/MasterGameSchedule.asp?n=59705&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br><br>With this:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=40348&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">https://leagueathletics.com/Page.asp?n=40348&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br><br>I plan to send an email out sometime over the long weekend.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Kevin

          It looks good to me. Not a lot of brackets for senior division this year.

          <p>Just reviewed it:</p><p><br></p><p>2015 Senior schedule isn't available on website with seed numbers. I think you posted it with the title of 2014 because that is there and it looks accurate with 4 teams.</p><p><br></p><p>2015 Junior--</p><ul>
<li>Tue, June 9th 6pm Game 3: Seed #1 vs Seed #4/5 Gile (HS)<br>this should say Winner Seed #4/5</li>
<li><p>Tue, June 9th 6pm Game 4: Seed #2 vs Seed #3/6 Kelly<br>this should say Winner Seed #3/6</p></li>
</ul><p><br></p><p>Overall I think this section is very confusing. It looks like a lot of the 2014 information is missing. Any chance we can reorganize some of this information so that the 2015 information is easy to find? and put all the old information in another folder or put one more layer for past years?</p><p><br></p>

          Updates made.  Thanks.<br><br>In terms of the page being confusing. It is really intended to be a landing page for the playoffs. The 2014 info needs to be updated (just haven't had time to do it).<br><br>The links that we will share with each specific division/teams will be the single pages for each division. Does that make sense?<br><br>For the overall page, we can look at doing something different but we will need to add it to the to do list.
