          Hi Shawn and Nick,<br>Shawn- thanks for volunteering to help out with the sponsorships. Nick had also volunteered last Fall when we were working on committees and roles.<br><br>Nick and I discussed having both of you review the Google Doc that Kenny had managed.  Once you both have had a chance to review, we thought it would be best for all of us (Nick, Shawn and Kevin) to meet.  I'd like to review the list and come away with an updated list that we would split between the two of you.<br><br>We could invite Kenny if you both would find it helpful.<br><br>Take a look at the link and when you have a chance suggest a few dates/times when we may be able to get together.<br><br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahe-NBA8GZFKdGpLc1RnVldGYy1HTmt1eDJacmE3enc&amp;usp=sharing&amp;authkey=CMr1sJQM" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahe-NBA8GZFKdGpLc1RnVldGYy1HTmt1eDJacmE3enc&amp;usp=sharing&amp;authkey=CMr1sJQM</a><br><br>Thanks!

          Hi Kevin and Shawn,<br>I reviewed this sheet and I think we should meet to determine and action plan. I think having Ken there is the right thing to do.  Are you guys free at all this weekend?  Maybe we could together Friday evening or Saturday morning.  My preference would be Saturday at 9:30.  I think we would only need 30-45 minutes?<br>Nick
