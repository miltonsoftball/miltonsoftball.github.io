    Nick...I ordered the Spring uniform shirts and visors yesterday. When will you have the final list so that I can give it to SuperFlash for the uniforms? I do not need it now or in the next week but it will be a week or so after. Do you have the spreadsheet from Kevin had from last year?

          Nick<br><br>SuperFlash called me yesterday, uniforms will start arriving early next week and they want to start setting up the sponsor names. I don't need the team names and the sponsor list just yet but I will need it sooner rather than later. If you just have the sponsor names or some of the sponsor names I can give that to them to start laying out the letters for the shirts. <br><br>Please post anything here on Basecamp. Thanks!

          <p>Hi Nick -</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know you have been after the three remaining sponsors for logo artwork and we are still waiting, I didn’t want to risk not having them on our sponsorship banners for Opening Day so I went ahead and did my best at recreating high resolution versions of the logos for the vinyl banner.  They are not great but I think they are decent.  I submitted the order for the sponsorship banner and I should have it by late Friday afternoon.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The other three banners have been completed.  I also created 11 new web banners for sponsors and they are now running on the website.  I would suggest everyone take a look at them (it’s always good to have another set of eyes).</p><p><br></p><p>The best way to see the banners is to go to each team page.  You will see the sponsor banner tied to the team at the top of the page and the sponsor logo in the lower right if you scroll to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.</p><p><br></p>
<p>I will let you know when I have the 4th vinyl banner in my possession. :)</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for all your help.</p><p><br></p><p>Kevin</p>

          Great. Keep in mind that the uniforms and the vinyl banners are final.  We can only change the website at this point.  <br><br>Thanks.

          Has anyone had a chance to review the banners on the website?  With the season underway, I want to make sure we feel we are in good shape.  <br><br>And as a reminder, the best way to see the banners is to go to each team page.  You will see the sponsor banner tied to the team at the top of the page and the sponsor logo in the lower right if you scroll to the bottom of the page.<br><br>Thanks!

          I started to review it earlier this week and then got sidetracked. I just reviewed every division and team and they are all accurate and look great.

          I just finished a review too and I think everything looks great.  I sent emails to all the sponsors providing their team assignments and asking for a review of their details.<br><br>I have 3 adjustments - Thayer Nursery should come down and we should add Traverse Insurance and Thatcher Farm to the sponsor page - I think I have their electronic info and will send separately to Kevin
