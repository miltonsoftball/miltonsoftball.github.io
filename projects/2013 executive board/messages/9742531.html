    Kevin, do you have electronic copies of what Rich worked on for the scholarship? I just downloaded the Milton Booster form as well as the Hockomock form and qualification document. I will review tomorrow but would prefer to edit online vs creating a new document. LMK either way, thanks!

          I will review the info you included as well as the Boosters info and the Hock info and create document(s) for both of you to review. Goal is to have a draft available by Friday.

          No draft today, sorry! I have read everything and have made notes but nothing formal. I am brining it away with me so if I have the time and energy I will write something up and post it but if not it might have to wait until Monday.
