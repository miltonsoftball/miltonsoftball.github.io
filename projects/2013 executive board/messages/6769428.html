    Thanks for your feedback on the logos.  It was interesting that the three of us all liked A10, C1 and B4 in that order.<br><br><span>It seems like A10 is the overall favorite.  I went back to the designer and asked if it made sense to have one logo that we use on letterhead, biz cards, website, etc. and then a variation of it that we include on helmets, or even uniforms.  She agreed with the idea and provided us with the following:<br></span><br>Please feel free to share your thoughts.

          LOVE the logo on the left for letterhead and so on and I wouldn't change a thing.<br><br>But for the logo on the right for the helmets and uniforms I would like the ball a little further to the right so that you can see more of the red (vertically) in the "M" or maybe make the softball a little bit smaller and leave the placement of the softball alone and that way you'll see the vertical red in the "M." If I am being too picky and the two of you like it absolutely go with it.

          I understand your point on the M, and I was a bit concerned on how plain the M is, but the softball makes the difference.  Maybe as you mentioned, have it a bit smaller.  Not sure if you want a more collegiate M, probably not, but just wondering   how plain the M looks.

          I'll request that the softball be made smaller.  I am envisioning it on the front of helmets so the smaller softball is probably a good idea.  <br><br>If we want to change the font of the M, it would have to change on the main logo for consistency.  I would recommend leaving it as is, but I am open to ideas.

          I agree, lets leave the M, for they are consistent

          Just to clarify, I agree that the font families should match and I like the M as is I just wanted to see a little bit of the red or make the sball smaller.<br><br>As an aside I will type up the BOD minutes, research mtg locations and email them next week. If we want to have an Exec BOD mtg before the end of the year we should schedule it soon with Christmas coming the month of December is getting hectic. I can host if we want to have it 7-9pm and have a little Christmas cheer. LMK

          Okay. With regards to uniforms, this is what I was thinking:<br><br>The word "Milton" from the first logo on the jerseys<br>The M and a smaller softball (set off of the M somewhat) on the helmets and the shorts<br><br>Do you think these would work?

          I like both ideas, one concern on the Milton across the jersey is losing the identity of each team, are you thinking "Milton" on the jersey instead of "Diamondbacks"?  <br><br>I just noticed the on the new art work above, with the ball being smaller, it could be confused with Tennis, maybe that ball could be a bit larger?  Or do you think it could be made to scale to achieve a softball look?

          I am thinking the Milton across the jersey is for Summer only.  I wouldn't change the spring uniforms.<br><br>We could make the ball a little larger.  Do we need to change the color?

          I go with what you think on the color, I think we all feel the yellow is girls, which is good, not sure if you guys see tennis there, if not, no worries.  Kev's eye and experience on seeing Ad stuff I trust.

          The designer has updated the logos and I have attached the latest.  I think we are there!  I am also asking SuperFlash to give us their thoughts on how they would translate to the jerseys and the shorts.  Let me know what you think.

          The Milton jpg without the ball &amp; "girls softball" is an option of what we have on the summer jerseys.  <br><br>The M w/ the ball could be on the shorts.<br><br>You agree?

          I do agree.  I think the logo looks awesome! great job, and I do agree on the #2 jpg, for those reasons of the softball.  I think the jpg for Milton without will be useful option for summer, sweatshirts, etc.  This is great stuff!
