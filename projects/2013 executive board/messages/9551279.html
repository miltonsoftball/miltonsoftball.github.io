    <h2>Playing Up Conversation</h1>

    Did either of you hear my conversation with Brian Monday night? We need to include something in the coaching sessions that states that you need to treat the younger girls and the girls "playing up" the same as all the other players. Brian basically said that anyone playing up is taking away from the other older girls on the team. I am mentioning this to you both because this is the Mark Ware mentality. Basically the younger girls play less time and less desirable positions. This doesn't work for two reasons: first, the older girl may not want and be able to play one of the infield positions (3rd base) and second, the younger girls may be better in the infield vs the outfield.<br><br>I just want to raise awareness to this issue.

          I did not hear any of that, but it seems to be two groups, those that get, and those that don't   It will be a major part of our Coaches Meeting and clinic, what the philosophy of our rec league is, what we expect and the best way to carry it out.
