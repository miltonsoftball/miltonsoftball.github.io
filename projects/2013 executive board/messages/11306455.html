    <h2>Reminder to Jr and Sr Coaches</h1>

  <div class="content">
    I think we should send out a reminder to the Junior and Senior coaches that they are not allowed to talk under their breath about the ASA umpires' calls. I think it sets the wrong tone and if they have a question they should talk to the umpire, not mutter under their breath or worse go into the dug out and talk to the kids about bad calls. I was at one game last weekend and it happened and again last night.Â
