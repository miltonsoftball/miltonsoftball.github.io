          For Saturday, I am trying to see where you have the bigger holes for help.  I have a later Graduation commitment, I would like to try to attend.<br><br>Karen, if you want to slot me for starting at 11 am with set up, and I will set up and work the Freshman skills.  And then the 1:30-2 slot for soph setup.  After that, if more help is needed later, it would be best for me to try to exit and come back.  <br><br>Not sure what Kevin and your availability is, except for what is already slotted.  Is this the best forum, to discuss coverage for the extended day, and what expectations are?<br><br>I have secured a Permit, which allows us to have the Basketball court, this will allow us to not let anyone on the courts to play, if it becomes an issue.  I will bring a copy on Saturday.

          I told Karen I'm available all day and plan on being there from the start. If I can take off a little early it would be great but I'm guessing we will need a lot of help with breakdown of grills, bunting, banners etc. <br><br>Rich had a gas grille we just need a wa to get t to gile. Any thoughts?  I'd love to do gas vs charcoal for obvious reason but not sure if one is enough.   <br><br>Any thoughts on transport?

          Kenny for Transport?<br><br>If transport becomes an issue, the charcoal grill is up at the Booster concession stand ( I think, i need to check), that is the fall back, if someone brings charcoal.

          I can be at closing as well, or last game, if it helps Kevin to get out earlier, if I try to exit it earlier around or before 2, and come back when needed, 6, 7?

          In terms of the grill, let me know if you want me to ask Kenny if he can help pick up Rich's or if we will go with the charcoal.  I don't have a preference.  The charcoal will take a little longer to get fired up so we should factor that in when planning set up, etc. so we can start selling on time.<br><br>I will probably end up being there the entire time.  I spoke to Rich and I will swing by Sydney's graduation party after the Senior game.   It will probably help to have all of us around for clean up. :)<br><br>Karen - Ray can do PA/MC for senior game.  He can also do sophomore or junior pregame introductions if we want him to (Jensen's can do the announcing of each batter once game starts.  Let me know what works best.

          Attached are the rosters for the three all-star games.  Can you guys take a quick look at them.  I start off going by standings to divide up the teams but then factor in pitchers, catchers, etc. to balance the rosters.  For Soph and Junior I used pitching data to help ensure each team had pitching (although we are missing a lot of pitching data).  <br><br>Both Senior All-Star coaches, pointed out that if we did a 1,3,5 for one of the rosters, then it would have too much pitching.  It was refreshing that both of them pointed it out.<br><br>if you can let me know by 11:30AM or so, it would be great.  I need to print them and then I am out at a client for the afternoon.<br><br>Let me know what you think.

          Soph and Jr--I don't know the Soph and Jr team pitchers and catchers, only a few so really can't comment on those.<br><br>Sr--Who are are the catchers on the west team? I know Lindsey Jensen catches but who else. The east team has Elena Kapolis and Eva Hiller. I know Emma Kelly will catch. Maggie Ware and Jess Brink will catch sometimes too. <br><br>As for spelling, I think these are the correct spellings:<br><ul>
<li>Sr East--Eva Hiller</li>

T-shirts were picked up yesterday and I will review them today to make sure they are all set.<br><br>Will you print out 2 copies of the menu on page 4 and the magnet price on page 5. I will bring poster board and adhesive. I will also bring a roll of tape to tape the poster boards to the tables.

          <br>Instead of me organizing them all together, should I just give half to one team and half to the other team at the end of the games? I  can package them up now and split the sizes evenly. Anal or organized?

          Ok, I counted all shirts and we are all set--28 Soph, 24 Jr and 24 Sr<br><br>I will ask post later to the BOD with one last updated spreadsheet who has ice duty and who has cooler duty and tell them that we need everything there by 11:30am.<br><br>I can call when I am on my way back and if necessary swing by Common Market and get more ice.<br><br>LMK update on grills and I will update spreadsheet. If Kenny can help us pick them up maybe someone that has a pickup truck at the last game can help us take them back.

          Sorry for the late jump in....<br><br>TShirts look awesome...I would be somewhat careful on whos hands they are in to be handed out, we always have a coach having an extra kid on their line up...<br><br>Rosters look great!  Nice job on balance, from what we know.  The Catcher piece is a hole other story.  As we know Laurie trumped us at the draft saying her daughter do not catch, and she has caught EVERY game, and Brown we did list as a catcher, as she had caught maybe 3x, but we did need to list someone as a catcher to balance catchers in the draft.<br><br>I forget, do we have the pitching limit rule enforced on all star games?<br><br>I noticed a mention of alot of ice....is one person getting it?  In the past, we had one person get 4 40lb bags and reimburse them.  As you mentioned, we will need double the amount for tomorrow, its only another $20.  You may want to have 2 different bodies assigned to ice, the first one brings 60-80 ilbs when you need it 3?, then another one brings some at 6 or whatever works.

          <br>On the grills...there are two gas grills I got approval to use that are up at brooks field.   I believe they both work, from what I was told.  If not, the charcoal grill use to be up there as well, but I have not checked to see if it is there.<br><br>It seems to me, transportation is a pain, and on the closing end, we would need a truck again.<br><br>I can not confirm the charcoal grille till this evening.  I would suggest, as long as we know Rich has an extra grill if needed, and Kenny will transport, we should go with the two gas grills that can be wheeled down from Brooks field.  I will test them this evening, if there is an issue, you can put the Rich and Kenny plan into place.<br><br>On the timing of the day, Karen, thanks for slotting some expectations, that helps me, as the graduation affair is down in Marshfield, and I will be looking to see what develops on the volunteer sheet for later in the day for coverage.  You have me on for 6, and it will be more like 7, depending on the need.

          Rosters--agree with Gary, outstanding job!<br><br>T-Shirts--I will hand the t-shirts to the coaches and tell them to distribute them to the girls on the roster only.<br><br>Coolers--I will ask everyone who is bringing coolers to have them at Gile at 11am or they can drop them off to my house by 10:30 and I can bring them to the park.<br><br>Ice--I will ask Ted to bring 4 40lb bags of ice at 11am to Gile. I will ask Nick to be on call to go out and get more ice. Kevin...you can ask him while I am gone. I will call Kevin @3:30 and see if we need more ice and I can get more ice. <br><br>Food--Kenny just called me, oh dear god the sky is always falling with that guy! He wanted to make sure that I knew that we needed the coolers and ice so I reassured him that we would be all set.<br><br>Grill--I think that the gas grills are going to work out great. We need to check the amount of gas in the grills so we don't run out. Kevin will you confirm with Kenny that he can pick up Rich's grill and get it to Gile? We will have to figure out how we're going to get the grill back home to Rich at the end of the night.<br><br>All Star Rules--I just thought of something, do we need to do anything with the coaches so they know the rules? Let the umpires know anything either.<br><br>I am going to check wecare email and update spreadsheet again and will post to everyone.<br><br>I am heading out @2:30 to pick up a few things so if you think of anything else call my cell 617-699-9783.

          <br>Karen, great job on the updates....<br><br>As a side note, for just us three to use if need be....the concession stand at Brooks field, has a freezer and refrigeration chest, we can put ICE in the freezer, and use the  cooler for food, if need be.  I just want to keep the idea within a tight circle, as most of the people involved in or on our board have High School kids, and although its perfectly fine for me to use it,, I would like for it, not to be seen as a abuse of a luxury.   Hopefully I am saying it right.<br><br>But we can definitely use it, without any worries, so if its an option, we can pivot.  The issue will be who and how many we want access to it, if need be.  It might be a good option to put ice or food, if the weather wins the battle for awhile during the day.  We could also put the ice cream in there, which might help.

          I think yesterday was a huge success, exhausting and too hot but I think the day was great. I think the only things that we forgot were condiments, a hole punch for the signs, and I will add utensils for the grill. I would like to propose that we pay for the tents that were damaged. I think one was the league's and if we need it then we should do get another one. I don't know who owned the other other tent, I know it wasn't Laurie's or Kevin's so it had to be Bill's or Gary's. What do you both think?<br><br>Kevin...when you send out a thank you to everyone for their help please tell everyone to post their feedback (positive and negative) to Basecamp. I will keep track of it and update the spreadsheet as well so we have it for next year.

          Yes, I agree, a great day all around, on any measure.  Congrats, with such a hot day, it was a recipe for more things to go wrong, and it all seem to go off without a hitch.<br><br>At some point, replacing the broken tents would be a good idea, and we know who has one in the future, if we need to borrow one.  I am not sure how broken mine is, so not in a rush, until I open it and see if it works.  Bill's was salvaged I believe, and its a bit bigger and different model. One idea would be, if we buy anything, replace his tent as a gesture in the future.  The one that was really destroyed, was the league tent I think, that I kept in the box.  Kevin can speak to the damage, he was there when they did their Mary Poppins.
