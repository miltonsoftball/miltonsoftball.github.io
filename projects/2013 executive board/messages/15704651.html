    <h2>Celebrate Milton!</h1>

    I had an idea I wanted to run by the two of you.  What if we participated in Celebrate Milton? The idea is to increase our exposure to the rest of the town.  I think we have an opportunity to reach parents and girls who are unfamiliar with the program and/or would like to learn more about it.<br><br>We would have a table, set up a tent (maybe see if we can have a tent produced with our new logo), use the Milton Girls Softball Banner and have free chotskis (pink wristbands and magnets).  <br><br>The event is on Sunday, October 6th from 12-4.  I thinking we could staff it with 2 people at a time with 2 hours shifts each (12-2 and 2-4) and have a group for set up and breakdown.  I have hockey (not sure of time) but will try to come for some of it - maybe for set up and breakdown.<br><br>Here is the link for sponsorship levels:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.celebratemilton.org/the-event/sponsors/business-sponsorship-registration/" target="_blank">http://www.celebratemilton.org/the-event/sponsors/business-sponsorship-registration/</a><br><br>I think the $60 or $130 would be fine.<br><br>What do you think?

          I agree, great exposure to a varied of interest groups.  If the Pats are not home, I would be happy to take a 2 hour slot. 12-2.

          What is the plan? Gary can you help set up and start with the first few hours? I can set up and start the event but I have to leave @11am to pick up Caitlin from her school from the Making Strides walk. Brian Conroy had volunteered 2-4. I think that's all we have for volunteers.<br><br>I have the sign to put on the table, the wristbands and the magnets as well as the decorated pumpkin. What else do we need?<br><br>Kevin...are you are going to type something up we can hand out and create a sign up sheet with emails? I'll bring pens. Also, check to see if they have a table, if not I can bring one from my house.

          I can be there for the second half.  I will be leaving the rink in Brockton by 1:45.  Gary did you want to help set up and possible help the 1st couple of hours?

          I can come by and pick up the tent.  The magnets will go back to storage.  Can I grab it in the next day or so?

          Sure and if I am not home I will leave it in the garage or if you don't need it I can give it back to you next Monday after the meeting.
