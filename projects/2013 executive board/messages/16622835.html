          Minutes look good.  Thanks for pulling them together.  My only question is about Jen stepping down. This didn't happen DURING the meeting but after.  Should it really be in the minutes?<br><br>I plan to send out an email to the board about her, Bill and the open E-Board position.  Maybe hold off on Jen until my email?<br><br>Do we have a location for Monday?
