    Hi there- <br><br>Here is a rough draft of the structure and talking points of the meeting on Monday, 9/16.  Feel free to edit and comment as you see fit.  Gary - I am particularly wondering your reaction to the section about expectations.  If it's too strong, please let me know.  I want to be transparent but I also don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.  Let me know what you think.<br><br>---------<br><br><u>Immediately Prior to the Board Meeting</u><br>
Kevin to talk to Rich and Kenny before the meeting (minutes before the meeting).<br><br><u>Expectations Not Met</u><br>
Let me start by saying thank you for meeting again under such short notice.<br><br>
As a leader, I have high expectations.  And when someone tells me they are going to do something, I expect it to be done.  There were more than several occurrences where I was told things would get done and they were not.  <br><br>
Conversations were held and expectations were set on several occasions.  The results did not change.<br><br>
It's not important what they were but I felt that they impacted the program and the girls in the program in negative ways.  It's not aligned with what I felt we were trying to build and I felt as a leader I had failed.<br><br><br><u>Miscalculation</u><br>
Like I had expressed at the last meeting, I was comfortable with my decision to step down. After listening to you express your concerns and after Gary, Karen and I had a productive meeting last week, it was clear that I miscalculated the effort required for a smooth transition.<br><br><br><u>Commitment</u><br>
Gary and I are staying on the Board. <br><br>
Gary has stepped down from the Executive Board but will remain on the board for at least 2 years.  I am extremely happy with this.  Gary is the face of Milton Girls Softball.  He has a strong love for the program and is wired into the community like no one else.  As a member of the Board, Gary will be focusing on X, Y and Z.<br><br>
Karen has committed to 2 more years. Karen has been a rock for the last year and will continue to do so<br><br>
I am also happy to report that Kenny J. and Rich F. have committed to the board for one more year.  <br><br>
And I am staying on as president at least for another year.<br><br>
Any questions?<br><br><br><u>Responsibilities</u><br>
Talk about the structure of our board and importance of balancing workload and responsibilities.  <br><br>
Hand out Committee list and descriptions<br>
Karen to post large post-its<br><br>
We are a working board and I need to do a better job at tapping into the experience and expertise that exists in this room. I want each of you to review the committees and select two that you will own and manage. Everyone needs to select at least two areas and one of those areas need to be as the lead.<br><br>
Attending and volunteering at events is a given.  As a board member, we need your presence at the Parade, All-Star Game and Championship Games.<br><br>
Spend time going over the groups.<br><br>Communicate dates for next two meetings<br><br>Adjorn

          This is going to be long...I have started this post 2 different times and keep getting interrupted and losing what I wrote...<br><br>First, I want to thank both of you for listening to me and for agreeing to stay. I say this sincerely, Milton Girls Softball would have taken more than a few steps back if you both left. I believe that the foundation would have been cracked and who knows how long it would have taken to repair that damage. I have enjoyed working with both of you for different reasons and I look forward to our next year together taking the program a few more steps forward. I need to be honest with you...I would not have quit if the two of you left but I would not have been happy with either of you for leaving MGS (and me). I tell my kids all the time that what doesn't break you makes you stronger, I am stronger because of what the three of us have gone through over the past year and I also believe that there is always a silver lining. Last night was our first step forward and I want to keep moving in a positive direction.<br><br>As for the message, I don't think it's too strong. Gary please weigh in on that issue.<br><br>As for commitment I think that we need to state that we need at least one more person to sit at the Exec level. I think we should create a list of questions and ask that if anyone is interested that they answer the questions in a personal email to Kevin and I (or wecare email) and then we can meet and discuss this issue off line. Gary I would be interested in your opinion after we receive the letters of interest.<br><br>As for responsibilities, specifically Gary:<br><ul>
<li>I think we should create a "community liaison" or a similar position and I think Gary should manage that area (which you do already). I think we could list relationship with the town of Militon, fields, additional fields, scoreboard. Anything and everything to do with our relationship with the town of Milton.<br>
</li>
<li>I also think we should create a "clinics" position and Gary maybe you could help and be the assistant to that area of expertise. Let someone else run the program but you add value and time to that area. </li>
</ul><br>As for my responsibilities:<br><ul>
<li>I want to continue to be the Uniform Director but I want to take the plaques off the list and move it to the sponsorship director. I don't think I need any help with that but I am open if someone else wants to help.</li>
<li>I want to leave the Rules Committee, honestly I don't think I add value and have a lot to contribute. I think that if we can get Pells to join us that he would be a great addition to that area or to lead the effort.</li>
<li>I think Dana needs help with the Equipment and I would be more than happy to be his assistant. Physically he just cannot do the work today and I think he needs the help. I also have a great relationship with SuperFlash and can be the liaison to ordering additional equipment from them if (and when) we need to order new equipment. Kevin, I also don't think you should be doing this work and this is something that I can take off your plate.</li>
</ul><br>Next year's schedule. What do you think of handing out the schedule for 2014 in November, that way everyone has the dates that we need people to commit to. For example, the parade and all star weekend and so on.<br><br>That's it for now.

          Few more things:<br><br>Director/Committee...should we call the positions Director? I am thinking that Committee is a better term so everyone that is working on something collectively feels part of a team. What do you think?<br><br>Scholarship Committee/Director...Please add a section for the Scholarship. I am happy to lead the effort again I do not have any conflicts. Ted and LJ were the other two people involved so Ted could step up and manage this effort if he isn't leading anything else and we need one more member.<br><br>Time commitment: I came up with estimates from meetings and activities. Neither of the items below take into consideration time working on committees.<br><ol>
<li>Executive Board Commitment...I just went through all my notes and my calendar from last year and my estimate is 20 hours in meetings for the past 9 months. As for an estimate I would say 10-20 hours on the phone/other conversations. Total 30-40 hours.</li>
<li>BOD member...I created a list of the commitments for a BOD member and I have 8 meetings per year @ 2-3 hours per meeting is 20 hours. Plus the additional activities (equipment, parade, all star day, championship games, appreciation) would be 10-20 hours. Total 30-40 hours.</li>
</ol><br>Hopefully this is it for the day but no promises.

          This is great info Karen.<br><br>Let's hold onto the hours for now.  I think the E-board number may be low and I think that the time some board members spend exceed the 30-40 (i.e Rich with Umps, Kenny with sponsorships).  We can include some details about the commitment when we sent out a link to the board about their interest in the E-Board position.<br><br>I like your suggestions about Gary's role but let's hold off announcing anything until I have chance to connect with Gary and receive his input.  For the meeting tonight, we can keep it high level.  Make sense?<br><br>And yes, I totally agree on the 2014 calendar for the Nov Meeting.

          I am posting late to both of your excellent post, sorry.<br><br>Kevin, your outline is very well done for the talking points for the meeting.  I did pause and reflected on your comments, thanks for providing them before any distribution.  Transparency comes before comfort, I think I have also already been transparent to my shortcomings, whatever you feel comfortable with is fine with me.<br><br>Karen- your thoughtful and very detailed threads are excellent.  Its obvious how much you care and give to the organization.  I do believe the three of us will always be stronger and hopefully closer for what we did experience.<br><br>You have alot of great points above.  Some need more discussion, ie. number on the EB.  Yes it can work with 4, but you still probably better off with an odd number to get a result in a vote.   Does not mean, 3 can vote, and have one position not vote.<br><br>I do feel strongly that the Treasurer should be an EB officer.  They have the purse strings to the organization, they have intimate detail (or should) on budgets, and should have input on creativity, growth and big picture.<br><br>As for the important thought you outlined in the committees and positions, I agree with alot of what you have outlined, very nicely done.
