    Hi Karen - With three divisions set (or 99% there), we can probably send the uniform order to SuperFlash.  Alyse said you can call her anytime and she would be happy to walk you through the process she followed last year.  I figure we can get the three divisions ordered and possibly the Senior Division as well since this division has not changed in registration count in almost a week.

          Be careful, Chuck (superflash) may faint, he will understand once he knows I am not helping with it.
