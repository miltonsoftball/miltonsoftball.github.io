          I just reviewed my comments and 3/5 were done, not sure if you have reasons why the other 2 cannot be done. They were:<ul>
<li>Estelle Renaud (Mariners 13 players) wanted to be with MacKenzie Mullaney (Blue Jays 14 players) -- <b>This is a tough one.  MacKenzie (Blue Jays) wants to be with Eliza Callahan (Blue Jays) (and Eliza requested MacKenzie). And 







</b><p><b>Lucy Moynagh wants to be with Estelle -- adding them all to the Blue Jays would not work so I opted to keep Lucy and Estelle together.  I am open to ideas.</b></p>
</li>
<li>Aideen Howard (Padres 12 players) wanted to be with Ella Regan (Rays 13 players) -<b> This was due to an email exchange recently where Ella's mom requested that she be placed with Ciara Fitzgergald and Isabella for carpooling.  I did move Aiden to Ella's team and then moved 







</b><p><b>Mairead Mcdougall from the Blue Jays to the Padres to balance it out.  Mairead did not have any request and she is coming up from Freshwomen so I think this works.</b></p>
</li>
</ul>LMK if you want me to review this again or if it's final, I'm available today and tomorrow.

          Nice work on the Blue Jays, and all the issues, looks great.  <br><br>Trying to review the Jrs excel and online list.  Almost done, but will have to finish after the 4pm game at Umass, Milton vs Scituate in hoops for a trip to the Garden next.

          Sorry if some of this is repetitive, best for me to list all inquiries or questions.  Some are comments that may have already been explained and I missed it.<br><br><i>Angels</i>- looks good, balance, pitching, etc<br><i>Astros</i>- Big number of 5th graders-<b>10</b>, this might be a function of bringing up Dana team, but are they all request.  They seemed loaded on skill, Dragon, Needham, Rundlett, Brink, Ward.  Bigger concern, no obvious assistant- Dana is best with a known entity (already has coached), I know he mentioned he will get help, but prior 3 teams no one let in (not sure if its as bad as the Losi factor, but we may give him that new label). Also, most of the parents that may be a coaching option already coach another team, and the other parents listed are mostly single (no male or female listed on registration- i know that might just be the way they registered).<br>Cardinals- has 12 and I forget if Morgan Gray daughter is going here to make 13 or to Giants which would make 14. Good balance.<br>Cubs-14 roster, with 2-4th graders which is coaches, good balance, strong skill, strong pitching (could be loaded with 4th grader additions, no option, similar to Giants)<br>Giants-I think Kevin mentioned concern on all request to play with these coaches.  4- 4th graders-should we let this happen without any limit test (ray use to invoke a light skill test inquiry), more than 2 should be questioned after coaches get there kid.  Lets keep the past rule for moving up, inquiry and skill needs to be evaluated. I noticed this is the combo of old Orioles team, which is good.  There is one potential women coach we would like to keep involved (did she put it on registration), Denise Quelly (good asset for program), we can make sure the over loaded, over coached Giants try to bring her in.<br>Rangers-12 roster, maybe we can add any late signups. (or if Gray is going here).  Good balance.  Eric needs an assistant, his last year, groom a successor.<br><br>Awesome work on the division, congrats!

          Just spoke to Bill Vaughn, he did not know of any 4th graders specific request to play with him or daughter.  It was more the parent heard Jillian playing up and "oh you can do that, we are going to as well".  Lets do the skill test- Kev, does this make it a pain to put them back on a sophomore roster to see how it would work?  If they did all qualify, they should be spread out among other Jr teams, yes?

          Great feedback. Do you want to look at suggestions?  Or was this more observations?  If we want to abide by assignment request I'm not sure what we can do.  Let me know what you think.

          At first mostly observations, and then I started to remember we did actually skill test the kids that wanted to play up. So to be consistent, we should skill test or evaluate every 4th grader that wants to play up that Dad/Mom is not the coach. (or all even coaches kids might be more fair).<br><br>You or  I can reach out to all 4th graders if you want that requested to play up and let them know they will be placed on a sophomore team with their grade level until we have an evaluation.  If they have the skill and safety skills to play, we place them, and let them know they may be the only 4th grader on the team, we should maybe think about limiting Jr teams to 2- 4th graders as a max or something.<br><br>I will schedule something up at Cunningham park on a Saturday morning and have them as a group, probably good to have every 4th grader have to attend.

          Gary - I emailed you a few emails regarding the play-up requests. This came to the gmail account. <br><br>They came in a wave so people must have been talking to each other. One of the emails referenced a conversation that the parent had with Bill with playing up. <br><br>I think that if a board member (like Bill) feels a girl can play up then I'm on board with it. <br><br>Also the scenario is different vs year past in that in the past a girl was playing up into a division with three older grades. With the realignment the grades are only 2 older grades. <br><br>I also think play ups from the lower divisions are not as impactful as from junior to senior.

          It does look like they all were talking, which is the way it usually happens, and we may want to let them know its not automatic (or is it?).  I think we evaluate all 4th graders and stem the tide from all of them asking to play up and canabalizing the Soph div.<br><br>Yes, Jillian has to try out, and the placement would go with the team her dad is on, that is consistent with the past.<br><br>I agree its not as impactful at the lower division  but we probably should have a step in the process to prevent them from all requesting.<br><br>Bill feels they <b>want</b> to play up, but he likes the idea of evaluating and putting some type of creditability to the request.  Bill did wonder if 4th graders are capable or not to play with 6th graders.  You may want to touch base with Bill, he seems neutral on the names and not looking to have it happen, unless its the best for all.

          Can you call each 4th grader today and explain the course of action you would like to take?  <br><br>The requests have been in place for weeks so we need to resolve this quickly and efficiently. <br><br>Thanks <br>

          I would be happy to, and I would be fine with leaving it alone.  It's not the action I want to take, it should be the action the League wants, either evaluate kids who wish to play up (no matter the division) or inquire to skill if not an evaluation might be sufficient, or just allow every request to play up with no regard for safety and skill.<br><br>With request being in place for weeks, a evaluation does not change anything, we cant evaluate till weather breaks, if you think this is already to late, I am totally ok with it, I realize it is effecting many dominoes already in place.<br><br>I am heading to the airport to drop off my middle one to head to FLA, let me know what Karen and you would like to do.  If you want me to call them, what are the answers from the League to the questions they will have, ie. are they on a sophomore team for now until they are evaluated, are they on a Jr team until then?  etc.<br><br>I am all for leaving it alone and work on the issue in the future.  I thought Ray had some type of process for this last year for the 4 th graders?  I think we had some play up, or inquire.<br><br>Do you think its a good idea to have 4 -4th graders on one Junior division team?  Maybe it works out fine.

          Wow a lot of discussion! Here is my 2 cents as a non-coach...because the divisions are only 2 grades (except for freshman) I am more receptive to girls playing up for the season. No difference than a few years ago. If its the first year a player has signed up I would say no (unless they are a superstar) but I would want to see their level of play. We could always ask last years coach for an opinion too.

          Here is a record of last year's play-up requests that came through the website.  For reference only.  All of the girls ended up playing up except for Newell (who changed her mind and stayed on the Juniors).<br><br>I don't recall Ray holding any type of evaluation with these girls but I could be mistaken.<br><br>It's ironic how early this week we were looking for kids to play-up to support another team at the Juniors ;)

          Let me know if you have any feedback on Sophomores.  My goal is to email the coaches tonight with information on how they can access their rosters and immediately follow up with an email to all Sophomore players letting them know their team assignments.  <br><br>The feedback was positive when we did this last year vs. allowing the rumor mill to stir with some coaches/daughters knowing and others not.<br><br>I am sure we may get responses from coaches questioning rosters but we will need to manage it.  Each roster move was done for a reason.<br><br>Let me know if you are okay with sending this email out.  Thanks.

          I agree informing the coaches and players at the same time. Avoids coaches daughters using that information and it might avoid requests to move players around when we have used a very methodical system to assign players. If anyone asks how we did it please let them know that I would be more than willing to explain it in person.
