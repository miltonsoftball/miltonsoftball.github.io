    Hi Kevin &amp; Karen,<div><br></div><div>I finally received the attached proposal today from Dirt Dawg.  Terrance O'Malley from TJO did get back to me by yesterday, and he outlined it over the phone, and seemed very flexible as well.</div><div><br></div><div>I will try to keep this email somewhat brief, and with just the important details for we can move forward with the clinics, but I need your input and approval to move further.</div><div><br></div><div>The details can be changed, altered, or please make suggestions to the following.</div><div><br></div><div>We were working on having 2 clinics, one for the Senior age group divison (7th &amp; 8th grade), and one for the Jr division.  As things have progressed I have given some thought to opening the Jr division to the sophmores as well, (why not).  </div><div><br></div><div>As of right now, the best night for the senior division seemed to be Monday's at TJO. (Sat, sun, along with other weeknights were considered). 7pm for 90 minutes, both companies the clinics seemed comparable (Stretching,Throwing Mechanics, Fielding, Hitting, Bunting, providing feedback and suggesting to have the coaches attend for they can learn what is being taught).  Clinic will be organized and run by the TJO staff.  Program can be expanded or shortened if we want to.  Feedback will be provided to parents and coaches.  5 weeks or 6 weeks, or 4 if we do not have enough time on the calendar.  Target start date, March 11, then 18,25, April 1 and 8th would be 5 weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>The Jr (and Soph if u think it would be good), is at Dirt Dawg (proposal has more detail) but same offerings for the most part.  Dirt Dawg offers are Satuday @ 3, Sunday @ 12:30, or Monday @ 5:30, all 90 minutes as well.</div><div><br></div><div>I could use your input on what you think a good time would be for the Dirt Dawg sessions.  Currently they suggested starting their sessions the week of March 23rd, 25th.  I told them we would like to start earlier, they can once we pick the night they will take a look.</div><div><br></div><div>All clinics we would have registration online, the cost to us is $10 per player at both outfits.  We would pay the company, be responsible to market the clinic and register all participants, (they both would accept drop in players for a $15 visit).  I think we package it as a $50 clinic, for 5 weeks, and or consider subsidizing some of the cost,or do we need to?  Maybe we spend money to have instructors come out to us during the season.</div><div><br></div><div>Size of clinics will not be an issue for either organization, they both will run the clinics, and both have tried to assure a good ratio of coach per player.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me know your thoughts.  Please suggest best game plan to advertise, do we do most of it by website (probably), but do we maybe also put an ad in the times (self promotion, positive image, new programs, etc.  Eblast at schools if we can get them to do it in correct time frame.</div><div><br></div><div>Kev, you seem to be great with timelines, do we have enough time to set this up.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for the help on this.  Pitching clinic is about to be finalized   Talking with Laurie on a couple of topics, the cost has seemed to increase no matter who or where we conduct it, so we are running the numbers and checking options at the schools vs the two companies above.</div><div><br></div><div>I did speak with the MHS softball coach and let her know we would like her and her coaches and maybe players be involved in some way, not so much for instruction but to intertwine the two, and have some type of presence or appearance just to observe, if it makes sense.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,<br>Gary</div>

          <div>Gary - this is very detailed.  Thanks for pulling it together.  Per your request, I do have some feedback:<br><br>
</div><div>I know we discussed going with one location vs. the other but I think it's confusing to offer two clinics at different places.  If the Clinic Committee feels that it's best to offer two locations, I will support it but I was hoping that we work with one location (and try to weave in a sponsorship as well).</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless of two or one location, my suggestion would be to start the clinics at the same time.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of Sophomores being part of the clinics, do you think the clinics would be watered down for 6th graders if 3rd graders were part of it?  Just wondering about the age gap.</div><div><br></div><div>I know you stated that both places can handle as many players as possible but what will the ratio of players to instructors be?</div><div><br></div><div>How much "space" will be designated for our clinics?  Will there be several stations or does everyone move from one drill to another (i.e. every 20 mins).  I would like to avoid a lot of kids standing around in lines - especially if the cost is $50.  I also didn't know how much space would already be booked by others that could impact what we would need.</div><div><br></div><div>The start date of March 11 works (I know we had targeted 3/1 with registration going live on 2/22).  I can get registration live quickly. I would defer to you on the # of sessions.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you pull together the details for each clinic so we can get it on the website, in an email and in registration?  Sending the school blast is a good idea - will you handle that?</div><div><br></div><div>We would need a description of what we are offering, cost, dates, time, and location.  We also need to any messaging you would like to send to coaches.  </div><div><br></div><div>One item I would like to  make clear to both organizations is regarding the collection information from our members.  I would make sure that we request that each location DOES NOT collect personal information about the players.  We will manage the registration and attendance - including checking players in when they arrive.  I know these places would love to get sign up information so they can add players to their email list.  I think this is a no-no  -- especially for a Milton Girls Softball sponsored event.</div><div><br></div><div>I think it's important that one MGS representative/ Clinic committee member (i.e. Board Member) be there to make sure it's running effectively, on time as well as letting players see a familiar face each week.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me know what you think.</div>

          Great feedback and input, thank you.  <br><br>I tend to agree with you on the one clinic location, and at this point its probably best to go with the trial route of using both and for this year see which program ends up being the best.  The sponsorship opportunity can still happen, and we should try to weave something together.<br><br>Start time would be best to start the same time, (same week)<br><br>I do think 3rd graders would be at a disadvantage, and will stick with original game plan of the Jr division and asses after this clinic, or possibly have a brief 3 session clinic for K-4 in April possibly.<br><br>Ratio of kids/instructor is around 1=10, so 30 kids will have at least 3 instructors, but a minimum of 2 instructors for a group.<br><br>Space will be dedicated based o size of group, both locations feel very confident the clinics will be given very large area, and they both have discussed the importance of how it is run, i.e. stations, kids moving, keeping them engaged.  It will be a hitting station, then a major area station to focus on throwing, catching, drills, etc. moving the kids from each station.<br><br>March 11th works great, I think 5 sessions works, and brings them almost to the season opening.<br><br>Will bring info to our meeting and firm up to be able to go live.  I will look into school blast on Monday 3/4. and Park and Rec to announce or distribute<br><br>Totally agree on the data information, and will make sure they will not be able to ask them to sign in or create a list for their use, etc.<br><br>I plan on being at each clinic, sign in, etc, and observe, supervise, etc.  Also have talked with Ted and Bill for help with clinic exposure.
