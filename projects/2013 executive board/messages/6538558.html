    <b>Where can I find the information on how many teams we had last year and the number of girls per team for all 4 divisions? Is there also a place where I can find the old schedules so I know how many games were scheduled? The cost of the umpires from ASA are $50 please confirm that this is the cost this year or who can I call? I will start working on this project after the holidays but want to start to collect all the data.</b>

          This is all on the website, if you do not have access, Kevin or I can get you a password.  I can help you with that info as well.<br><br>The ASA umpires are $50, they have been for 4 yrs, so I would not be surprised to see if they try to bump it to $55, but for planning, lets go with $50.  The Jr umpire program we are going to revamp slightly, and I can give you those projections.
