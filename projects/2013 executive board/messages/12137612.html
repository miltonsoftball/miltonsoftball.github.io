          I think it's all fine and yes I would leave as much time at the end of the week for rain delays. If we can get Curry that is great. I am going to the Rockies game on Sunday night at 5pm so the standings won't be finalized until late Sunday night? or maybe we can figure it out Saturday night? What do you think?

          We pulled a favor last year for Curry (which gets old), I am going to go a different route this year, as I reached out to Ken Quigley the president, and will see if we can start up a partnership, that will expose our future college bound softball players to his College, and invite his Softball coach and hopefully a player (to the playoffs, and to future clinics) , possibly a local one, like Abbey MaComber who played in our league back in 2000-+, who I coached.

          The 8th gr social is a dance and my understanding is that everyone goes and is a big deal. I don't think we should have games that night.

          The playoff schedule was changed slightly to allow for an extra makeup day for Seniors if necessary since we will not play Senior games on Friday (but can play Sophomore and Junior games if necessary. <br><br>The early forecast does not look promising. <br><br>The changes have been updated on the website.

          I heard back from Ken Quiqley yesterday at Curry.  We had a good discussion of how MGSA and Curry could work together for there is more exposure for both Curry to us and for us to have the opportunity to use the facilities.<br><br>I requested the 16th and the 12th.  He said he would like to help us if the facilities are available.

          This is great. It's the 12th and the 15th. Not the 16th.

          I read Laurie's email about the remaining games and wasn't quite sure how to respond. What have we done in the past? If not why would we do anything different. I did look at all the divisions and not one division has played the same amount of games. How and when do teams take a loss if they don't play a game?
