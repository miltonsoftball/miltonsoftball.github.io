    I may have missed it under the spring to do list, but I think we had Eileen Mayer work with Bob Marotta and making sure the teams would get a notice of when Bob would be taking pictures.  Kevin and I received an email from Bob yesterday with his schedule for this weekend for pictures, starting tomorrow actually.  He also left me a message tonight asking if we can notify coaches/teams to help get a full turnout.  <br><br>Kevin, did we send a notice via email last year or by the website?  I think we sent something to the teams, but I do not remember (Eileen I thought did).  You may have already sent something, if not, maybe one of the Board members might want to help, or I could send a notice.<br><br>Karen, not sure if you knew of the setup with Bob.  For all the team pictures he sells (after taking the picture for free and putting it on his website), he credits back to our program, x amount of dollars as a contribution or fundraiser.  We used some of that balance last year or the year before for some plaque work.

          I left a message for Bob and emailed him last night.  Teams he listed on his schedule have been notified about picture day.  Subsequent emails will follow once Bob nails down the remaining schedule.<br><br>Bob is close to becoming a sponsor so the cost for the photos/plaques may be provided to us at no/little cost.
