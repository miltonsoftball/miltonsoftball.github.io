    Do you think its okay to have a makeup for Summer,  this Sunday?  There have been a handful of people asking, can we do the same notification process and ask them to register?<br><br>Kevin, what is the best way to announce the makeup tryout?  It would be for U10, U12 and U14 for those that did not make last week. Kelley field at 2pm, if it makes sense.  Will group them together and break them out if need be.  I can get the help needed to run it.<br><br>Coaches- I need help on figuring out summer coaches.  It looks like we will have 2 -U14 and 2 -U12 teams.  It appears we do not have very seasoned coaches (coaches that have done summer prior).  Returning from last summer would be Brian Conroy for a potential U14 team.  Josh Brink coached a team, and we need to talk if he is a good fit for summer level.  That would leave U12 pretty open.  Last year U10 was Dana and Carroll.  Ted is doing the U10, Dana is one of the U12.<br><br>More importantly- The girls that tried out to play up at U14 level, (u12 age), what have we done in the past, and what should the protocol be this year?.  One reasoning, is to have the girls play at U12 to keep our U12 teams competitive and best chance to win Championship in their division.  Feedback or ideas/input would be helpful on this, the sooner the better, thanks.

          Makeup--Did we allow makeups last year? If yes I am fine. I think I am fine anyway. I don't know what the numbers are, will we be able to have 2 teams for each age?<br><br>Summer Coaches--<br>U14--I don't think Josh's daughter Jess is playing summer ball for Milton. I think she I on a travel/weekend team. Want me to ask Mitch to ask Josh? If Brian Conroy coaches we'll need one more.<br><br>U12--is Dana ok to coach summer? I spoke w his wife and he is in tough shape physically. If yes we'll need one?<br><br>U10--If Ted will coach one then we'll need one more?<br><br>Should we have another exec mtg soon?

          What about Ted Carroll coaching a U14 team, is his daughter playing U14 this summer? And do we have other options for the U10 coaches to coach summer ball?<br><br>Also, I was correct Mitch told me that Josh said that Jess is playing on the Bay State Thunder team this summer.

          <div>I think you need a makeup date.  I think it's too late for this Sunday - especially when it's suggested on Friday.  The best way is to announce it via email to the entire league.  Send me the particulars and I am happy to send. </div><div><br></div><div>I would also suggest you email the parents who emailed you/the league directly.  Those emails are on the we care email account - in the INBOX and/or in the Summer Tryouts folder.  There are 3-4 I think.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of coaches, I think Brian for U14, Dana for U12 if he wants it/can do it and Ted for U10.  Gary - are you or Pel coaching U14?</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of the 2nd U14 and U12 coach, have we looked at the current Spring coaches?  Who is under consideration?  Can you see Laurie, Bill V, Eric K, Dan Rose, others all possibly being in the mix?</div><div><br></div><div>I also feel girls should not be playing up but I will defer to the Executive Board's consensus.</div>

          Good feedback, thank you.  Makeups will be next Saturday morning, 8:30-9:30 am at CP.  Its the only time it will work, there are kids playing at 9, 11 and 1 that I checked the rosters that it will effect.  I will get the one or 2 that it will effect at 9 am out of there at 9 to head to their game.<br><br>It will be for all 3 age groups.  I will email those from wecare, thanks for the heads up.<br><br><b>Summer Rosters &amp; Numbers</b>- U14 we had 20 kids tryout, + 3 from U12.  U12 we had 24 kids, including the ones that went to the upper tryout.  U10 we had 9 kids at the tryouts, with a known 3 that could not make it.  So we will have 2 U14, 2 U12, and 1 U10 team.<br><br><b>Coaches- </b>I should try to clarify the goal of summer coaches, is to obtain (find)the coach with highest level of Tournament knowledge and experience if possible, and if not, the coach with the most tenure that has shown exceptional coaching skills in the spring league.<br><i>U10</i> is the  the only team that is set, which will be Ted Carroll (his older daughter does not play summer).<br><i>U12</i>- Dana confirmed he will coach a team.  Brink has Allison on U12 tryout.  I have not asked Josh about coaching.  After last summer, U14 he was in over his head (without the difficult drama students/parents).  U12, maybe it would fit, but it would not be first choice (Karen, keep this to us). So we need to look at spring coaches that had kids tryout, which would be; Brink, Jensen, Eric Kelly.  Eric may be the one to target.  <br><i>U14</i>- Conroy is confirmed for a team.  Pel and I are not coaching a U14.  I was going to Co-Coach the U14 team, but it looks like I may be doing a U16 Tournament team (not all Milton).  Karen- would Mitch be interested in coaching a team?? We would LOVE to have him!! I see one name on the tryout list that has a coach in spring program, Tagney, not sure, what do you think Kevin?.  There are 2 names that have coached in the past, O'Shea, and B.Carroll.  The program would rather not have to go there. So U14 looks tricky.  We should have another 2-4 girls at makeups which will give us 11/12 per roster, but tricky on coaching. <br><br><b>Playing UP</b>- As Kevin knows, I have not been an advocate about playing up in Summer Travel (summer tournament, I have a different belief), but have always allowed to tryout at a higher level if they wish.  We have in the past had a couple of isolated cases, that based on their tryout and space, they have played up.  I do agree with Kevin, and I think if the EB is unified, we do not have playup available (except in extreme, rare case that fits a number of variables).<br><br>The objective should be to have the girls be the best in the division their age allows them to play, which in turns gives the Milton Summer travel team, the best chance to compete for a championship in the A division.  With that being said, some girls can continue to excel by playing at a higher level, but its rare.  The tryouts for this year U14, we had 4 girls that tried out or asked for U14 that are U12.  All these girls, except one would be better served in U12, imo.  Better for them, and better for the U12 division.  If there becomes issues that we have to re-evalute, we could possibly say, the only up option is the B team, but we may need to think that one through.<br><br>While I am on the topic of playing up and A/B teams.  Coaching we obviously would love to see the A team have the right coach.  In many cases, all leagues, and programs, many kids get to play at a higher level because their Dad is coaching. Its no exception here, and for the record, last year, Brian was in line for the A U12, based on the number of years coaching, and number of years him doing summer teams.  His daughter was low on the depth tryout chart, so I asked him as a favor to coach the B team, instead of the A (not an easy thing, for him, but he did it).  We then needed a A, coach, and thought Josh could do it, but that was my fault, Josh was not summer travel ready.  This year, it could be similar  but with little to no other coaching options, Brian will probably deserve to be the coach of the A.<br><br>While I am on my rant about coaching, as this is all confidential, the summer travel program does not have the caliber of coaches we need to compete at the A level.  That is not a knock on any individual, its the exposure that they have had to this point, but its all about the numbers, and what we have in stable.  To solve this problem, we need to continue to get them young and early, at U10.<br><br>I have the data and numbers tallied from the tryouts, I need to put it into the spreadsheet and formalize it.  After next Saturday, we should be able to email everyone by Sunday night.  <br><br>Recap-<br>U14-Conroy, Lewis?, Tagney?....<br>U12- Rundlett, Brink?, Jensen?- (Brink and Rundlett look to be on the same team based on the tryout numbers)<br>U10- Carroll

          I will always keep everything that is said in person and on Basecamp confidential.<br><br><b>Coaches</b><br><br>U14--I have been talking to Mitch about coaching and to be honest he just can't commit with his commute. (He did say that if you could find him a new job south of Boston as a financial controller he would coach for MGS.) Sometimes it takes him 2 hours to get to Milton and for no good reason so getting to travel game as the head coach he is just not comfortable with making that commitment and then not being able to deliver. Sorry! As for O'Shea he helped Conroy one summer and not sure that he is summer coach material. I don't think of Conroy's daughter as A team but I guess you would need to put him as the A coach. I do not know anything about Tagney coaching. I also don't know how the kids rated so not sure who the other coaches could potentially be. If you get the names into a spreadsheet I can review for you if you need me to.<br><br>U12--Has Jensen asked? I don't know how we say no to her with her commitment to the BOD. Are there any comments/complaints about her spring team? If not I think we have to give it to her. I do not know anything about Kelly's coaching, he is a great guy though.<br><br>U10--we are all set, right? one team only.<br><br><b>Playing Up</b><br><br>If the goal is to get the teams to championship games with potential wins then I don't think we should allow kids to play up with one exception. If we need to fill a higher level team and the lower level team would have enough kids. It is very tough to draw a solid line in the sand though because of the way that we run the rec program in the spring by grade level and the summer is by age. If I had to choose I would say only if the ability is there and the need is there.

          I have attached what looks like the summer teams to play in Hock.  We have a couple of holes for coaches and I am waiting to hear back.  The following is the coaching situation.<br><br>U14 West- Brian Conroy- no other options, has the most summer experience on the roster (available coaches)<br>U14 East- Open- Reached out to Nick Tangney, then will ask Brian O'Shea.<br>U12 West- Dana Rundlett- No other options<br>U12 East- Open- reached out to Eric Kelly- Any other suggestions???<br>U10 West- Ted Carroll- needed another 7-8 players for a second team, and a coach- to much of a stretch<br><br>I did receive an email from a MHS grad (Danielle Kavey), played varsity softball, now a freshman in College. She would like to help coach or coach.  She could have done a U10 possibly, if we had the numbers.  The U12 would be a big reach, but could be a good assistant or help.  We may have to consider her for U12, if no one steps up. (very last resort).  I will be positioning her as a great assistant to help run the practices for the potential new coaches that are worried about the commitment.<br><br>Kevin, is there an email we sent out to the players, or did we have the coaches do it?

          Gary -<br><br>Are you going to share the results of the evaluations?  I'd like to see how the players rated across the various categories.  Did you use the same rating system we have in the past?<br><br>The league sends out notices to each player letting them know the team name (east/west) as well as their coach.  We also have them submit information for uniforms.  How much will summer cost for 2013?  We are going with new uniforms across the board to leverage our new logo.  We can confirm with Chuck that the uniforms cost is the same as last year.  <br><br>Prior to the email going out to the players, we typically call the players who did not make a team.  It looks like this is ONLY U10?  When did you want to make those calls?<br><br>We also need a date for the summer coaches meeting. We use this time for parents to meet the summer coaches, submit payment, etc.  We have included this date in the email that goes out.<br><br>I am happy to send this info out once we have it.

          I also noticed that Annie Berry is listed under U14.  You had mentioned that girls should be playing in their age appropriate team.  I think this is why you have Jensens and Johnson on U12.  Is it appropriate to make an exception for Berry even if it's schedule related?  Are we sending the right message by doing that?

          Be happy to share the numbers.  I tabulated the total of all the scores and took the mean, pretty simple, same as in the past, except last year, I think I weighted an additoinal metric, but forget.  I can make copies and send you the sheets to see the various evaluations.<br><br>Cost is the same $150, (152.50 with online fee).  We netted a significant surplus last summer, we should have put that $$ into Red catchers and team bags, maybe this year.  At $150, we are one of the highest, if not the highest in the hock league.  We net, anywhere from $30-$40 per registration.  Last year if we collected all monies (which I dont think happened), the net profit would have been over $3k, I think we should a surplus over $2,500, but not sure.  We should direct these funds  back into the summer program.  This year, as discussed, we can use some of it for hitting instruction.<br><br>U10, is one team, with a roster of 12.  We would need to recruit 8 more 10 graders, and a coach.  That is alot of issues I think.  If you want to send out an email and try to recruit 8 more, great.  I spoke to Ted and he is for it, but I think it introduces to many issues.  There will be 3 kids on U10 that will be considered Alternates, I will call the parents and explain that if one of the kids do not except the position or someone gets hurt, they will be the alternate.<br><br>Season schedule from Hock is still not finalized, but looks to be June 24th start.  We could have meeting the week before.  Pick a date, I continue to pick dates that have conflicting events.  I am out of pocket June 10-17th. (traveling)<br><br>Annie Berry has not been contacted or asked, but I placed her on the East, as mentioned, if numbers are low, we can pull up the best player available from U12.  She was superior over every U12 tryout.  Its not schedule related, the roster determines it.  If we need another person we can go to the next U12, which would be Samantha Jensen, etc.

          Attached is the eval scores for the teams.<br><br>U14 East Coach will hopefully be Nick Tangney<br>U12 East Coach- Eric Kelly cannot do it.  Shawn Ward will assist at times, will have to ask Smokey Rulon, maybe he and Shawn, along with the MHS grad that wants to coach. <br><br>If you have enough info and feel comfortable with data, we should send out the email.  There were a couple of mistakes on U10, and cleaned that up.  <br><br>The 3 Alternates should not receive an email.  I will email and call them separately.  One is  Gayle Carvalho girl.  I have emailed her already and let her know her child is on the bubble and will be an alternate, is that going to be a big issue, and would she want to coach, if we tried to get a second team.

          Team assignments--U14 Fitzgerald doesn't have any scores. U10 additional team and getting 8 more girls interested IMO is going to be very hard and if the girls (and families) don't want to/can't make the commitment I think you're setting the team up not to succeed.<br><br>Playing up vs not playing up--I understand that the goal of summer is competitive play and using your best players. I also think that the way the leagues are defined is somewhat to a fault. You can have someone born on 12/31/98 and they have to play U14 and someone born on 1/1/99 and they are supposed to play in U12. This doesn't take anything into account as to the type of player that they are and can they handle playing at the higher level or should they play at the lower level. I think that if we need a player to play up because of numbers we ask the strongest/most competent player in the lower level and ask them to play up.<br><br>Alternates--I don't understand what this means...does it mean that the spots are given to the girls on the list and if one of them changes her mind and doesn't want to play we go to the next girl in line to fill that spot?<br><br>Money--I think updating the catcher's equipment and the team bags to red is a great idea. Looks more professional. I also suggest that we buy 2 coaches shirts per team if we are going to have a coach and an assistant per team. I think that too makes Milton teams look more professional. I also love the idea of the hitting instruction.<br><br>U14--I need to bring up this subject again for summer ball and that is Mark Ware, is he going to be allowed to be asst coach?<br><br>MHS Grad--I have another idea, pick the team that you think is the strongest and has the best chance of going all the way to the championship and give that team the MHS grad as the assistant. If the goal of summer is to be the summer championship winner and you think this girl can add a lot of value teaching I think this is her best use of time.<br><br>Coaches meeting--if the league starts 6/24 and Gary is not available 6/10-6/17 then we have to have the meeting Tues., 6/18; Wed., 6/19 or Thurs., 6/20. Playoffs will be done by then so pick a night and I'll call Cunningham Hall or the Library and book it. LMK

          Gary - <br><br>Thanks for sending this.  I had a few questions.  Was there a reason why we didn't use the matrix we have used in the past few years?  What you sent is a summary but not tracking the scores from each evaluator?  I also noticed a few formulas did not calculate and as a result it may impact rosters (Lang is one example).<br><br>Attached is the matrix we have used in the past (I believe what I sent to you prior to tryouts) as well as my comments on the doc you sent.  A few items in yellow seem off (a score of 19 for Rulon?)<br><br>Sorry to be so thorough but I want us to be 100% confident on the data in the event we are asked about it.<br><br>In terms of Shannon scores, she did not go to the tryout.  Did she attend the makeup tryout?<br><br>I am happy to discuss on the phone if you'd like.

          I can not view excel at work, so I can not view these till tonight.<br><br>In reference to the prior matrix, I honestly forgot to use it.  I guess I was looking to keep it simple from the data collected.  3 scorers, the average of the scores, and we have a number to rate them. <br><br>Thorough is good, we want it to be clean data, I may have a few mistakes in there, and correcting that is important, thanks.  There is no doubt, when we have scores of say 8.66, 8.5, 8.33. its a fine line that separates the skill vs the score.<br><br>Shannon did not try out, Rich Fitz spoke to me and said she not be able to make the second tryout, I let him know it is not necessary based on the knowledge and information I already have on the player.<br><br>To Karen's points- Brian Conroy is coaching U14 W, and is technically allowed to ask whoever he would like to help him.  As a league, we can let Brian know, that Mark is not allowed to be involved in coaching summer.  I think Kevin mentioned he heard from Mark that he is not going to be involved with Summer coaching.<br><br>I believe we should consider having a summer injunction on him, but lets discuss.<br><br>On the MHS grad, good idea, but most likely will not be in a position of strength for placement, it will be more based on where she is needed to fill a hole.<br><br>The good news is, Nick is in for U14 E.  Now we need U12 E- which last resort will be the MHS grad.<br><br>Thanks for all the good input.

          I did review the excel docs, and thank you for putting that info on it.  Would you want me to go back and put the data we have this year, into the weighted spreadsheet?  As mentioned, I was looking to do a simple, quick eval, with the composite of the 3 evaluators.  If you think it will change the outcome, I will fill in the weighted score sheet.<br><br>The Rulon 19 was a typo, it should be a 10.<br><br>Lang is one of the ones that is tied at 10.  There is a group tied all at the bottom, and I have shared some names that are tied with the coach for his on input, which matters to him, for possibly help with coaching, his knowledge of seeing them,etc..  Lang should be above Carvalho.

          I am suggesting that we collaborate on the data before we announce anything.  In the last 4 years that I have been involved in summer we have shared the data and review it to make informed decisions.  I would like to continue be part of this process especially as E-Board members we need to stand behind it if we are asked.<br><br>In the past 4 years, we tabulated the data from each evaluator by skill (throwing, hitting, fielding, etc) by player.  This allowed us to see some of the trends and possible anomalies that may result from a particular evaluator.  <br><br>I also scanned in the original evaluation sheets and shared them with you.  <br><br>From what you sent, we only see the average score. I think it's important to see the detail from the evaluation sheet to the summary sheet to the sheet you sent us.  <br><br>It will also allow us to understand how to break ties in scores (i.e. Lang) when the difference could mean being on the team and not.  <br><br>It will also allows us to dig deeper on some of the evaluations - like the girls who tried out for U12 and U14 and how their ratings fared across both.<br><br>if this is not possible, let me know.

          I agree, its best to keep it consistent.  Attached is the tabulations and data from the 3 score sheets of you, Mike K and Rich F.  My scanner is broken, so I can drop those off, if you would like them.<br><br>I did not re- tabulate by total score, I left it in the order of my original scores, which shows some of the differences or errors.  The 2 nd tryout names have less data, and is does not weigh the same to say the U10 girls that had more data.<br><br>After you re-tabulate, we can look at the minor differences and why some may be have been off.  Kate Rulon comes to mind, no matter the score, the father said she would like to catch, and the 12 B team needs a catcher.  U10, Coach Carroll talked about Dunn, and Ward.  The coaches should get to see the list if there is only one team, and it comes down to help with coaching, skills, etc.  (imo)<br><br><br>Just realized, the excel doc, I can not send from this computer, will forward shortly.

          Thanks for including the scorecard evaluations.  I tabulated the data and there is a statistical issue with how the averages were calculated in your original rankings.  <br><br>You took the total score from each evaluator and then averaged the scores by dividing by the number of evaluators.  The issue is from looking at the scorecards we have some discrepancies.<br><br>Here is one example:<br>Evaluator A rated the following: Baserunning + Outfield + Throwing<br>Evaluator B rated the following: Baserunning + Infield + Throwing<br>Evaluator C rated the following: Baserunning + Hitting<br><br>Taking the data from one player, here are the numbers:<br>Evaluator A rated the following: Baserunning (2) + Outfield (3) + Throwing (3) ==<b> 10</b><br>Evaluator B rated the following: Baserunning (2) + Infield (2.5) + Throwing (2.5) == <b>7</b><br>Evaluator C rated the following: Baserunning (2) + Hitting (3) == <b>5<br></b><br>In your calculation, you took the 10, 7 and 5 and averaged it to determine a score.  This issue is that Evaluator C only evaluated 2 categories where the other two evaluated 3 categories.  This puts the player at a disadvantage because she is in fact missing a score.  It also reduces the value of Evaluator C since only 2 scores of his are being counted where the other evaluators have 3.  <br><br>We rectified this in the scorecard we have used the past three years by keeping each score as equal weight to give us a balanced rating.  It would account for evaluators missing ratings of some players without penalizing the girls.<br><br><br><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b><br>The challenge is that we are running out of time.  We need the girls to register, provide uniform sizes and get the orders into Chuck.<br><br>I wish this was a more collaborative process in the 3+ weeks since tryouts so we were not rushing to get this in a good place.<br><br>The rosters have been assigned on the website per your original excel doc.  <b>Gary</b> - can you verify they are accurate?<br><br><div>

          Before I move a player up from East to West, is there any objections moving the best player up, which would be Annie Berry.  I do not care either way, but we had a discussion, which I am not sure was confirmed either way, allowing U12 to play up.  This would mean on a case by case basis, we move the highest rated player to a spot if it opens up.<br><br>I missed the May 8th hock meeting (I will be sending the hock up date next as requested), the prior meeting in April, was a conference call, which I was present.  At that time, they were still targeting 6/24, as the hgssl website, also confirmed, no set calander dates where determined, even until after the May 8th meeting I missed.<br><br>Monday night games are U12.  That would be Dana Rundlett, and Shawn Ward.  IF they had a home game, maybe it would not effect them, depending on what time the function is starting.<br><br>I believe I did make all changes to the website, I will check one more time and CONFIRM.<br><br>Coaches/Parent meeting a gave a range, I do not know what you think works better, a Saturday am? (league games), Saturday afternoon?  that would be June 8th.  Friday is open, and Thursday, June 7th.  If I remember from last year, it was difficult having all 5 or 6 teams to be covered the same time, unless I have some help. <br><br>There will be no calls to be made on Summer U10.  We are having 2 U10 Teams.  The roster is made, and can be added to over the next 24-48 hours, now that we know we will have 2 teams.  Would you like to announce via email that we have 4 openings for summer u10 to the U10 age?   Hopefully you are okay with sending out and including the U10 East team with the master summer email.

          Yes, I agree to your comment on the playup policy, as my last thread referenced we had a discussion, and was not sure of making any policy.  Would you and Karen make a determination on what you would like to do, either a policy or case by case, or whatever you feel is best.  As referenced, it does not matter to me, I was looking to have a guideline to use, as we have cases of players looking to playup, thanks.<br><br>I also agree on U18, the comment was more for the future, looking ahead, not for this year.

          If you feel Annie is best player on u14 east, then I guess she should move up to west. I think she would be a stud on U12 and be middle of the road on U14 east or west. I would look at the ratings as pick the next highest. If its her then she gets the west spot. <br><br>Do we need to add another player to U14 west with Shannon f not playing?  So two players need to move up?<br><br>

          I just spoke to Ray about an hour ago, to let him know I am not doing a U16 tourney team, as he has been asking me to help him with U18 if I do not do U16.<br><br>I also texted Nancy Fitzgerald to let her know, I am not doing a U16, as she was waiting on Olivia and probably Shannon.  I let Nancy know I offered to help Ray with the U18, hence my note on U18, since Ray did it outside last year, and I just came from the Hock meeting on Wed, and they have U18 teams, along with SS.<br><br>I will most likely either help Ray or look to see if there are enough kids to do 2 U18 teams, now that there is no U16.  Ray mentioned he has Ed Durfer helping him, and Coach Pel and I were looking to have a team, so not sure how crowded the kitchen will be, but Ray and I are going to see what kind of numbers there are, and see if there is enough for 2 U18 teams, otherwise, I would like to help him with the U18 if it fits.

          I am confused about you doing a U18 hock team.

As a JV player, like Shannon and Ashley, I feel as a parent that it's best for them to be competing against high school talent.  Kate would not get that at the U14 level (with at least half 8th graders).  If she does not make the U18 team, we would keep a spot for her at U14 West.  <br><br><b><u>Next Steps:</u></b><br><b>Gary</b> to look at rosters and determine what shifts we need to make to get each roster at u12 and u14 balanced with 11-12 players each.

          Wow, I do find the immediate okay of the U18, a rather quick turnaround, after the multiple threads on the topic that had inquisitions of me yesterday.  <br><br>I do want to present a discussion that Ray and I had, about the possibility of 2nd U18 teams, if the numbers presented themselves.   I need to figure out, do I need to get permission, if I wanted to submit a 2nd U18 team?<br><br>In my opinion, the U18 South Shore league does not present a very competitive opportunity, and I am not so sure, that the U14 A Hock division, may possibly have better pitching in some cases.  We should be careful on letting U14 be an automatic play at that level, when they should be concentrating on playing U16.  Having a U18 open to U14 so easily, acts as a default to accessibility.  If our U14 kids cannot place in the playoffs or win championships, in their summer league, playing in a U18 league that is inferior to Varsity Level High School (in my opinion, this U18 league, although important in its existence, is comprised of HS players that are not achieving to make starting varsity in High School.  This is not a bad thing, it is softball, good softball, that allows girls to play, that are not playing possibly where they should be, if they want to be a Varsity starter).<br><br>Our girls in our summer league have the prerogative to choose to play where they would like.  Tournament, or travel.  With not having a local Tournament option, only the most dedicated players go seek out tournament play.  As U14 players, by seeking out to play in what is perceived as a higher level at U18, the reality of higher level of coaching, execution, development, etc, is not always the case, which usually ends up in disappointment.  Lauren Kinsella comes to mind as a good example.  I do know, the parent and the player was excited and had a belief of belonging to a U18 as a U14 was associated with being good enough to belong.  With out asking Mike for permission to this example, he has openly stated, it was a mistake.  <br><br>I believe our U14 girls are going to aspire to belong to a U18, because its a HIGHER level.  Higher in number only in some cases possibly.<br><br>If we restricted our U14 girls from playing in our U18 program, some may go find another program (and it would not be a U18 program most likely), some may not play, but the core that does play U14, makes them better players, playing with their peers, friends, and similar level of skill.<br><br>I am not against having a U18 program.  They typically exist as a throw together, as its a battle for players as some work, they are older and have different responsibilities.  It is a great division to be able to offer.  My concern is offering it to  U14 players (or making it so easy to play up), who are just learning the commitment to becoming better.<br><br>In reference to Ray and U18, he knows, I am still looking to find a U16 Tournament situation for my daughter.  Since it has not worked out yet, as disclosed yesterday, I need to look at U18 for her.  His numbers look fine at this point, if my daughter gets a U16T opportunity.<br><br>I will look at the rosters to see what moves might be possible.  Ripple effect, I agree, looks like it might be a tsnaumi, but we will see.  Off the top of my head, the next highest score to move up and be offered to U14W, from U12W, would be S. Jensen or both.  That could be interesting.   The U12 West, has  12 players, IF we moved the two Jensen girls to U14W (Brian will not be happy), that would leave U12W with 10, and we would move one 12E to U12W.  U12 E has 13 on the roster. I will submit on a new thread, recommendations based on the equal weighted data.<br><br>Kevin, I could use your help if you could send an invitation to play U14 East to Mike OTooles two girls (Hannah and ?)  I am not sure if they will accept, but that team is at 8 players.

          Yes, let's discuss a second U18 team before any action/request is made. <br><br>Before I go through the work of sending the O'Tooles an invite can you find out their interest?

          Kevin, I already have stated on the email threads, OToole was interested, did not make tryouts, just like Rich Fitzgerald.<br><br>Based on your email on the confirmation you sent out the Summer notice, you included the link saying Karen and I could use it, to send it to whoever is interested.  <br><br>I will send out that link to OToole and any one else that I hear may be interested.  To bog down the process that has already been documented to move forward, will just delay things.  <br><br>Coaches have been notified.  I received no Feedback on Danielle Kavey, from Karen or you.  I have not reached out to her.<br><br>Balancing of the rosters does not look to be a quick fix.  I think one of us should send out an email to the Summer coaches via wecare that until confirmations are received, rosters may be altered.  Feel free to send something out if you think it would help communication.

          Danielle - I'm okay with it as long as the commitment is there. You proposed several scenarios so I wasn't sure which one you preferred. <br><br>O'Toole - thanks for sending the link out. I was confused because one thread you said they were interested and the other said I don't know if they will accept. <br><br>Rosters -if Jensen were to move wouldn't it be u14 east?<br><br>Coaches - I think email to coaches should come from you through the wecare account as you have been working with them.

          We are going to go with the 50 we have along with a few that we know are coming in.  <br><br>I spoke to Karen earlier, and let her know I will be emailing her tonight with the final numbers, and there may be a couple of names not registered, that will be on rosters, we are expecting, that have told me they are committed.<br><br>I will confirm shortly.  As of right now U10 A is set, U12 A and 12 B are set, U14 B is set.<br><br>U14 A has some issues<br>U10 B currently shows only 4, with 2 coming in from Shawn Ward, and 2 coming in from Maggie Radley.  I anticipate at least having uniform sizes for them by tomorrow, as they know they need to register.  This still leaves us short 3 to 4 short for U10B.  Kevin, I suggest you send out an email to the U10 population, seeing if we can fill the 3 or 4 slots.  By tomorrow afternoon, I will let Karen know if we should order some U10 B uniforms for they go in with the original order.  At a minimum, I am guessing, we will order 2 uniforms, without knowing for who yet, for we will have a total of 10 for a minimum ordered for the U10B.  <br><br><b>U14- FOR THE RECORD</b>- I did mention to Karen earlier, as I felt this was not dealt with correctly, we are making a Mistake with letting the U14 girls playing up to U18 (as the way it happpened). Not going to go into here with another long email,but it clearly has hurt the U14 team and program dramatically.  We should be first filling the program teams that we have ALWAYS had.  With opening the door, with the way we did it, we did not have a chance to protect or defend the prior process.  I understand parents can make their choice, and if its a coach or a situation that may force that choice, that is their prerogative.  But if the U18 was not an option, the way it was, the U14 choice would have been, Milton travel, or find an outside choice. (U16 Tourney, U18 whatever).<br><br>We currently have 8 girls registered for U14 West.  With Rundlett not wanting to sign up if she is the only 9 th grader, and McAuliffe not signed up, she had stated interest in U18, was emailed by Ray, no roster space and needs to play u14, but has not registered for U14.<br><br>This forces me to consider interest that I have received from Dedham.  They might have a couple of girls either U14 or U12, asking us to consider using them if we have space, since they are not doing Hock, they are doing Tournament teams at U14 level.

          One point I'd like to clarify. We did not LET any girl play U18. It was a decision made by themselves without our involvement. Shannon never tried out for U14 and in talking to Rich never committed to U14. She was holding out on the hope you were setting up a tourney team - which would have hurt U14 and U18. U18 was her backup plan. <br><br>Ashley's decision was beyond our control. We didn't LET her play up ether. She also fills a need that U18 had - no catcher. <br><br>Kate is signing up. Check wecare - I think she had a question. <br><br><br>The issues arethe following:<br>- we have competing agendas throughout all of this. Gary tryong to do a U16 tourney team and many in limbo wating<br>- Discusion of a 2nd U18 Hock team <br>- we got started too late and lost too much time.

U12 E-set, U12 W-set, with potential to offer TWO jensens to move up-TIMING IS NOT AS CRITICAL, have a day to see if we should consider Dedham players- Have 4 girls to play, one good pitcher. Would be good solution-would need to address bringing in outside vs moving up. For me, i like leaving them to excel at apporpriate age level.  We cant win A championships to begin with, it wont help moving 12 to 14.<br>U14 E-roster needs to be filled<br>U14 W- set

          I am updating the rosters as the registrations come in for the new U10 East, making the changes on the website.  Any new additions, Karen knows I will contact her to add to the uniform list.  As of right now, any changes to rosters look like they would not impact uniform request, and roster ADDITIONS will.  I will keep Karen up to date on additions, and then both of you on the final roster changes.<br><br>What do you guys think of the Dedham option......?? for U14 E<br><br>Courtney Lee registered last night after our meeting.  She has been placed on the U10 E roster. Karen, please confirm you will put it on the uniform doc, thks.<br><br>As of tonight, the U10 E will stay fluid.   Karen updated this afternoon with me the uniform request and added R. Johnson, and Chloe Donovan as they showed registered, and I have added them to the roster.  We are expecting two more to that roster.  The U10 E is going to have 2 sets of sisters, with one in 2nd grade, and one coaches daughter who is in 2nd grade.  There was a brief discussion of that young will not be an impact on skill most likely.  As we were looking to populate the roster, this is what happens, I think it will be fine.  This is why you may see 13 on U10E.

          My initial reaction is no to keep it to Milton. If we don't have enough players and we want to keep the U12 teams alone we could entertain it. My main concern is how do we deal w/ this going forward. Are the girls playing spring in Dedham? Can they try out like Milton? Will they take Milton spots first? And so on

          I would recommend we keep it to Milton. To be fair we didn't send a followup email to the league asking if girls were interested in playing summer like we did for U10. If we need more girls I would suggest we do that first. <br><br>I think it opens up a can of worms on both sides that we are not prepared for.

          An email to all summer travel players (as of 4:40pm) has been sent.  Gary - although coaches received the email as well, can you make sure they understand it's importance and we need their presence?

          Thanks for sending it out.  I did send all coaches an email on Monday (6/3), giving them a heads up, we will be having a meeting on Sunday (time tbd, probably, am, at CP), along with an update on expected schedule from Hock, and the mandatory Coaches meeting the hock is holding on June 12th, location TBD by the hock.<br><br>I did express that this will be a critical meeting that will give an opportunity to hold a coaches meeting.  I did hear back from Shawn Ward, that he is involved with a road race in the am, and will be available after 1 pm.

          I am up to date with the wecare.  We have been waiting for 2 U10 E registrations, and was confident they would be in, we have had a couple of new requests and have let them know rosters are complete.  If I do not have the U10 by this morning, I will make sure the final 2 are added today.<br><br>The U14 E has not been an easy one.  Nick has let me know that if the Jensens get the offer to come up, the OToole will not play.  He would like the Dedham option instead.  I let him know the Dedham option presented to many issues, and he understood, he may loose the Otoole, and would be disappointed but will go with what has to be done.  I will speak with Laurie this am, and hope she stays at U12, if not we will offer what we need to complete U14E, and U12.

          I did let her know, she meant U14, but with her and I had Arleen Bernardi just ask me if her kid could play, that would be 2 to add to U14 E.....and not go to Laurie....but I need to chat with you about it.  It has a few hurdles.  You free?
