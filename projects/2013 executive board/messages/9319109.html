    <h2>Spring Senior Coaches</h1>

  <div class="content">
    From Gary's earlier post, here is an updated list of coaches for the Senior Division:<br><ul>
<li>
Josh
  Brink—returning 
</li>
<li>

Brian Conroy—moving up 
</li>
<li>

Laurie Jensen—moving up, need to have
  discussion re: conditions 
</li>
<li>
Ted Carroll - confirmed by Gary 
</li>
<li>
Meg Toyias—confirmed by Gary 
</li>
<li>

Arleen Bernardi—moving up, need to
  confirm 
</li>
<li>

Greg Lang—need to ask <br><br><br>
</li>
<li>Note: Mike O’Toole will assist a team.<br>
</li>
</ul><br>We had discussed 5-6 teams depending on registration.  As of 3/6, we are at 71 registrations in the Senior Division.  We had targeted 78  (6 teams x 13 each).  We seem to be in a tough spot.  6 teams of 12 will be tough - especially without Player Agent in the mix at the moment).  5 teams of 14 ... ugh.)  What do you think?

          Okay I just looked up the rules, Senior division can play 10 girls with a minimum of 8 and 7 players is a forfeit. I would opt for 6 teams of 12. I think sitting out 4 girls every inning is too many not playing.

          I agree,, six is worth running the risk.  Last year was the worst year we have ever had in my opinion with the teams not having players.  I do think its much more a reflection of the coaching and on the coaches.  We can help address it at the coaches meeting as well.

          I wil agree with you, but I think we need to brainstorm how to get the player's agent working again this year.  It will help for sure.<br><br>So we have 5 coaches confirmed/available.  Arleen and Greg are the current options. Any preference?  Anybody else in the mix?<br><br>if Kinsella moved up it would solve two problems (Juniors and Seniors). :)

          Maybe Mike would move up if he could bring his two nieces, he thinks one of them is a superstar and she wants to play up maybe.  Friends will probably be an issue.<br><br>Brian Conroy said D'Amato helped him last year, I did not look at registration, not sure if she is coming up, if so ask Brian what he thought of him.<br><br>Players agent needs to be shaken out more when we get the coaches together. It was not so much a negative hearing all the work Jen did and how tricky it is, I think it is more the whole board has associated it with being very tricky (difficult) to make it work.  Lets re package it for the coaches or maybe someone interested that wants to be on the board (future position)<br><br>Dare I say, you know who would do it......Laurie Jensen....ha ha....full disclosure that is not a recommendation!

          Laurie would probably be very good at it - but if she is an existing coach it's too much of a conflict.<br><br>Thoughts on Arleen and Greg?

          Not alot of help on the Arleen and Greg front, not even sure if Greg assisted or has stated interest in the past.  Email Arleen and check interest I guess (my thoughts of having Bernardi and Jensen for 2 years coaching seniors, I should be more christian thinking....it is lent).  I dont think we have as much negative feedback on Arleen as Laurie, its just that knot after last year trying to pull a fast one bringing on unregistered friends to play.<br><br>My reserved comments for the EB eyes only, is we are thin on character for coaching at the senior level.  I guess I feel if exceptions are made for Laurie, Mark probably should have been given the same rope (warning).  But then we double our headaches or potential problems.

          From hearing the feedback on Mark, I think they are different situations.  Mark's has consistently demonstrated poor and unacceptable behavior directly or in front of the girls.  <br><br>I feel the circumstances around Laurie are more coach-to-coach level and her self-appointed role as rule cop.  <br><br>After hearing all the feedback, I would not feel comfortable with Mark coaching.

          <b>Gary</b> - I connected with Brian today about D'Amato.  He said he is a very nice guy and  has helped him out for the past few years.  Brian said he was good with the girls.  Not very instructional but helped out.  He was not sure if he would want his own team or if he would prefer to help out a head coach.  <br>[<b>Karen</b> - FYI - D'Amato was an assistant in the Juniors for a few years and he indicated on the registration that he could coach.  It wasn't clear if it meant a head coaching position or an assistant.  In talking to Gary yesterday, we wanted to learn more before we made a decision on the last open Senior coach.]

          Sounds positive on D'Amato, looking forward to discussing. Head coach at Senior level is a different level (world), we hope to look for a coach with experience teaching softball skills, fundamentals, and prior head coaching (in a perfect world).  But they have to be able to handle the girls.<br><br>One tidbit from observations over the years, with Senior Coaches.  In the past with the Sr division being 3 years, we did see many coaches either first assist in Sr then take over, or come up from being a head coach.  The coaches with less experience did have the extra year to learn on the job and improve by the 3rd year.  We may want to consider the learning curve (baptism of fire) is a bit shorter now, with less time to correct the mistakes of coaching, which just may make us take a closer look at Ray's spreadsheet from a planning perspective, (who is head coach in Jr level coming up next yr, etc).

          I agree with your thoughts on D'Amato and head coaching at the Senior level.  I think he would make a good assistant and if we get stuck looking for a senior head coach, maybe we consider him (if he is interested).<br><br>So, what's are next move?  I think we said that we would reach out to Arleen and gauge her interest.  <b>Gary</b> - are you okay with me doing that?  Otherwise, we are running out of candidates and may have to reconsider Mark as we discussed.<br><br>Let me know what you both think.

          I had a conversation with Laurie and expressed the feedback we had been getting regarding her role within the program.  I told her that while it's great that she attends games, she needs to avoid inserting herself into games regarding rules, rosters, etc.  She understood and expressed to me that she acknowledges that she needs to not get involved.  I told her that as a coach, board member and (at the time) the Junior Division Coordinator, she cannot leverage these roles during her games or during games she attends.  With that, I offered a Senior Division coaching position to her for the 2012 season.  <br><br>On anther note, I emailed Arleen regarding her interest in coaching (without offering the exact role).  She replied back to me Wednesday afternoon (from my Sunday email) and told me that she said "I travel quite a bit and am concerned that I will not have the time to devote to it.  I have not decided just yet but will let you know as soon as I decide.  If you have someone else that you think can devote the time you may want to go with her/him."  Based on this response I feel she will not be able to dedicate the time to being a Head Coach and that she is better suited in the role as an assistant.<br><br>We also received feedback on another option - Tony D'amato - and the feeling was that he would be a good assistant but that he has never been a head coach and throwing him into his first head coaching position in the Senior Division may result in a  not-so-positive experience for all.<br><br>The last coach on the list is Mark Ware.  I spoke to Mark today and discussed with him some of the good and some of the not so good feedback we have received over the past few seasons.  I looked back at survey feedback from last year as well as the year he coached the Junior Pirates and Summer U10? team (with Conroy).  There were several very positive comments about him and how he worked with the girls.  I also shared with him that some areas that require some focus occurred in the summer playoff game two years ago as well as this past season.  He did recognize that his behavior was not at it's best and he also pointed out that he gets competitive in the summer.  I agreed with him on that statement.  He is very excited, enthusiastic and very much looking forward to softball.  He also pointed out that this is the last season he will be coaching his daughter who moves on to high school next year.  <br><br>Taking into consideration the positives and negatives as well as feedback from Karen and Gary, I made the decision that Mark Ware would be offered a coaching position in the Senior Division with the stipulation that he needs to manage his emotions and keep his behavior on the field in check.  He accepted.<br><br>Mark and Laurie are enthusiastic and BIG supporters of the program. I wish we had other coaches and parents show this much excitement.  I am confident that they will demonstrate to us that we made the right decision.<br><br>I ask that outside of the three of us that we show an united front regarding the coaching selections.  <br><br>Feedback is welcome.

          Is this the final list?<ul>
<li>Josh  Brink</li>
<li>Brian Conroy</li>
<li>Laurie Jensen</li>
<li>Ted Carroll</li>
<li>Meg Toyias</li>
<li>Mark Ware</li>
</ul><br>I will say to the three of you that I am disappointed with both selections but Mitch and I are both not in a position to be a head coach and I also have no other candidates or suggestions. I believe the saying is put up or shut up so I will be a team member and will keep my mouth shut.

          I agree they both are not ideal, and they would not be coaches if we had more options.  I am going to be hopeful going into this that they understand they have an opportunity to improve their situation.
