    <h2>Fall Ball</h1>
    <p>Posted by Gary Kelly on August  5, 2013</p>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    As we discussed and agreed, 2013 Fall ball will be in two different leagues, since the new Stoughton League does not offer U14.  The U14 Fall team will play in the CRL league again, (last year being the first year trying it out), the U10 and U12 will play in the newly formed Stoughton Fall league, which is all Hock teams, and all games played in Stoughton on Sunday's. (10 am and 1:15).<br><br>The U14 CRL information is not solidified as of yet, there was a meeting in Dedham on Aug 15th  but has been moved to the 19th (tentatively), I may be away, not sure yet.  I will find out if we need representation, or email is fine. Its at that meeting or after we state our interest from what I understand.  I have already stated via email, we are submitting a U14 team for this Fall into CRL.  I confirmed our entry into Stoughton last week, and awaiting to hear back, but I do believe we are all set, just waiting for official word in print.<br><br>I have reached out to the 3 coaches (West div), Brian Conroy is in for U14, will follow up with Ted and Dana today. <br><br>What do you think the best process is to send out the email for Fall ball.  Maybe send it to all the West roster players tomorrow, and then Wednesday to the East, and let it fill on who fills up first.  <br><br><b>Cost</b> -for Stoughton is $375.  CRL is $300 ( I think umpire fees are not included, but tbd).  Rosters can be up to 20 kids.  I think $30 fee would work, what do you guys think?  (if avg roster has 12 kids = $360, will probably balance out between the 3 teams).<br><br><b>Housekeeping items -</b>(add to it please)- Payment - checks payable to MGSA-best way to collect?  Cant play unless its in?  How can we help keep it out of coaches hands, mail them in? drop off at Kev's house?  Fields- have talked with Dave Perdios, he is checking soccer times, etc at Gile.  We will only need one field with U14, I think Gile is best. (we had no issues last year that I can remember).  Umpires- Rich Fitz.  This might be a good time to try a different area coordinator? Coaches needs- game balls, umpire fees for U14.<br><br>I appreciate the help with the Fall league, thanks.

          Good stuff.<br><br>Just a couple of thoughts:<br><ul>
<li>Do we ask Ray if he wants to coach U18 or U16 (if available)?  Is it an option for CRL?</li>
<li>Are we capping rosters at a certain number?  How are we setting expectations on playing time if we allow 15 or more to register per team?</li>
<li>If CRL does NOT include umps we need to factor in $50/game x 5 home games = $250.  $250 + $300 = $550.  Are we charging enough?  It depends on # of players per team and playing time.</li>
<li>We should add in cost of games balls too</li>
<li>Last year we charged $35 per player for Fall FYI</li>

          * I did inquire with Ray last week on U18- he says yes, and will find a coach if he cannot do it.  After a discussion at last nights game with him, he was not sure if enough would play, but was all for including that age or group for letter of interest <br><br>* Rosters caps can be done.  Have not given a thought to a number or cap, probably a good idea if we need to guide expectations if we had a large roster.  Has not been the issue in the past, usually trying to get 10 or 11 to field a team.  What is best?  <br><br>*CRL cost I had noted incorrectly!  The $300 for CRL is an actual deposit they hold and never deposit, and tear up at end of season, unless there was a forfeit that was not handled according to the bylaws- which ends up to be a $50 charge, and deducted from deposit.  So no actual league cost, and the home team pays for the umpires and 2 game balls.  If there are 5 weeks (2 or 3 home doubleheaders), up to 6 games maybe, so $300 for umpires would be a guesstimate.  Good point on it probably would not have been enough with my prior numbers, but it should be okay with home team paying for umpires as the only major expense.<br><br>*Cost of balls I factored in a rough budget of 1 doz each team ($55 /doz), but did not add that cost into the cost of the registration fee, looking to keep the fee to $30 per player, thinking it needs to be attractive for a Fall option sport, but that was my mistake, I thought we charged $30 last year, so we can keep it at $35 if we want. <br><br> Budget thoughts were the following (when I was running it at $30 per player)<br><br>Total Revenue-  $1080 ( avg roster of 12 @30 = $360, 3 teams)<br>Expenses- Umpires CRL - $300<br>                  Umpires STOY- $275<br>                  CRL league fee- 0<br>                  STOYAC fee-    $150<br>                  Balls  -               $165<br><br>Still have a bit of room if rosters are an avg closer to 10, and no rain outs, that do not get made up.  Last yr, CRL, we did not use the total $300 budgeted for umpires, as a few games could not be made up.<br><br>* Updating an email sent not on basecamp on how Stoughton Fall (STOYAC) league fee changed it to $150 and you pay for half the games played for umpire @55 per game.  Max cost for Fall would work out to be $425.<br><br>*Lastly- the next step for Fall interest or registration is where I COULD SLOW THINGS DOWN- after talking with Kevin last night, I was thinking there was something we could just reproduce from last Fall and send it out to the 6 or 7 summer teams to get interest or sign up.  I don't think we do have something that exist, and Kevin mentioned for me to just get him some wording.  I will not be able to work on this until the weekend now, as I just got word (3 am this morning) my Uncle passed away, and will be tied up today into tomorrow night with the planning, as I am his health care proxy.  I can look to get some ideas in print over the weekend, unless either of you can help put something together.<br><br>*Playing up- Kevin had a good suggestion of setting up registration or interest by the age group and fulfilling rosters first, then going from there after we see the numbers.<br><br>* Ted is in for U10 but may not be able to do the first game, Aug 25th, which is to early.  Dana has touched base with Shawn to help him with U12.  Brian is in for U14, and Ray will make U18 work if the interest is there.

          I believe you are right about the start date.  Gary mentioned he has the schedules and would send them along.  U14 and U18 are CR.  U10 and U12 are Stoughton.<br><br>Maybe Gary could reach out to the coaches and have them do a little recruiting?

          Hi Guys, sorry for the delay.  The CRL league starts Sept 8th, the Stoughton league starts this Sunday, 26th.  I have spoken with both of them, via phone and email, and sent them wecare address yesterday, asking all communications to go to wecare.<br><br>CRL is for U14 and U18.  The U18 level does not have any teams yet, and looking to see if anything materializes over the next 10 days, they know we have less than a handful registered and will evaluate with CRL, as it looks they will not have enough U18 teams to play.  U14 I think will be okay.  Brian is away this week and spoke to him last Friday before vacation, and seems set and ready.<br><br>Stoughton has had a couple of teams including us with some late registrations, (due to early start I think), but they do start this weekend, U10 and U12.  Spoke with Tony the director the last couple of days, keeping him posted that this weekend might be an issue as registrations are still coming in.   He understands and we are in contact with the other teams we may need to reschedule.<br><br>Spoke with Dana yesterday, as he and Shawn were looking to help build out the roster, and Dana was hopeful to play this weekend, hoping they can get to 8 or 9 for Sunday, which would be great.  I will be calling him shortly to see how the numbers look, and will go check registrations as well.  Lets update what we have as of this am for registrations (Karen, thanks for sending numbers each few days, that was helpful)<br><br>U10 looks like it will be close, and I reached out to Maggie Radley to see if she wants to help coach, as Ted sent me a text on vacation, that it looks like it will be difficult to coach and his daughter does not want to play.  If Maggie can not do it, I will coach the U10, but this Sunday is not possible, as I am bringing one of the girls back to PA to college.  <br><br>I will be speaking with Tony (Stoughton) today, after I talk with Dana, and then check in with Kevin.

          Thanks for posting the schedules.  Can you double check on some minor changes I made to Registration sheets (and roster)  The 2 Ward sisters were signed up at U10 level and should have been U12, I put them on U12 roster (and moved them off the registration list of U10 to U12.  Ashley Vaughn was registered on U10 and I moved her to U18 registration list, as she is on the U18 roster.  There is a Taylor Condon on registration and on U10 roster, her birthdate indicates a U12 level, but she is not on our master membership (spring), so I did not move her to U12 as of yet.  I know Dana has asked someone to play, and I have inquired with him, to see if its that name.<br><br>The coaches for U12, Dana and Shawn, I assigned them onto the roster.  They are both recruiting, and as of right now have enough to play tomorrow by asking Jillian Vaughn to play.  I mentioned to Dana to Call Bill and see if she can play, in order to get the game played.  I know we asked girls to register to the level of their age, and we will see how the numbers are, and the numbers are such, as you mentioned, like U18, maybe have girls play where eligible/needed,  I think the only 2 U10 players that stated interest before registration were Vaughn and Carroll to play up.<br><br>On the U10, I thought I would send out the names that have registered to Ted and Maggie (U10 summer coaches) and ask them to look it over and look at their summer rosters and see if they can help with names, ideas, friends, etc, to get the roster to 10-12.<br><br>This weekend, Stoughton league, our U12 is playing, and the U10 will not be playing.  Tony, the director of Stoughton, has contacted the U10 opponent (Tony has not distributed team info yet for contacts), and I have asked him to get us together for we can reschedule if possible.<br><br>For the CRL, the U18 does not look likely.  As Kev mentioned, we should see if the girls registred for U18 would play U14 (if eligble), right now the U14 roster has 6 girls on it.  We need at least 3 more.  Brian is back tomorrow, and I will ask him to take a look at the roster, and try to recruit some names.  I did add him as coach to the U14 roster.<br><br>I have provided Bill with the payment info for Stoughton ($150 league fee), $55 for one game on each Sunday (5 games).  The coaches have the rules and know the fee to pay umpires, Bill will provide them with the funds.  The coach also knows they need 2 games balls for 5 games.  Dana is checking on inventory.  CRL league cost are just umpires, and Bill will provide Brian with funds for 5 games.

          Thanks for the update.  Dana seems ready to go for tomorrow.<br><br>Everything looks good roster wise.  I would just reference the website vs. the excel since a few more kids have registered and have been assigned to teams on the website<br><br>Did U10 get canceled across the board or just our games?  <br>You may want to send an email about the ppd game to the U10 roster since they probably received a game reminder from the website.<br><br>Is the $150 Stoughton fee per team (so we owe $300)?  Looks like we need 42 girls across 3 teams to break even or 38 girls if the $150 is just for Milton (covering both teams).  Hopefully we can get the numbers up.  <br><br>Let me know if I can help in any way.

          It was just our U10 game vs N. Attleboro that was cancelled, sorry for any confusion, as the email link above stated no game for us this weekend for U10, and it did not register with me, about sending out a cancelation notice.  It finally hit me on Rt 76 in PA, and sent it out last night, and then personally sent them all an email when I arrived late last evening.<br><br>The cost is $150 for the league, total, which makes the math work a bit better.<br><br>Numbers are starting to firm up a little better, it looks like Maggie might do U10, and she may bring in a few players as well.

          I am good for the 9th.  Hope you guys had a good last few days of summer.<br><br>The Fall ball continues to evole, as the U14 is set with CRL, and we have received the schedule (attached) and confirmed our league spot.  6 weeks, 3 away, and the travel is not bad (Needham, Wellesley, West Roxbury, no lexington or waltham).  U14 registrations are up to 8.  Spoke with Brian, and he thinks he can get a couple after the hockey schedule comes out this weekend, and I will touch base with Maggie Ware and a few that have not signed up.  We also received an email from a Hingham parent that wants to keep her daughter playing, so I will reach out to them.<br><br>The U10 is up to 10 players.  The coach might be Maggie Radley or her daughter, if her daughter plays we will be at 11.  I have been in touch with Maggie, and waiting to hear back.<br><br>I thought I should  send out an email to the registered players of each team this weekend, with an update for the Fall season, intro of coach, season info, since they have signed up and have not heard anything back yet. (that okay?)<br><br>Cost of Stoughton is $150 for both teams, Bill sent a check out.  The CRL is umpire fees only.  The Stoughton league they pay for one game on each sunday, Bill was going to issue the two coaches checks.  Dana was going to check on game balls.<br><br>The U10 game that was not played last week, we are looking to make up, and have had contact with the coach.  I let him know once our coach is firm, we will look to find a date, if possible.  <br><br>U18 looks to be happening now at CRL.  I let them know we only have 2-3 registered.  Looks like Ray sent out a notice for interest, lets see if that draws anything.

          <p>Hi all -</p><p><br></p><p>Gary - thanks for the Fall Travel update.  Couple of thoughts: </p><ul>
<li>I appreciate the cost summary for Fall and your idea about asking players to pay the difference.<br><br>I think we will need game balls as I think the excess inventory was used up during the spring playoffs.  We also got hit with a processing fee on each paypal transaction (~ $2.50 for each registration - it's the price we pay for convenience). It's an administrative headache asking for more $, tracking who paid and who didn't and answering questions as to why one age level cost more than another.  I think the league should just eat the cost.</li>
<li>I saw Lauren Radley listed as a U10 coach but I think it should be Maggie, right?  I changed it.  You can let her know that if Maggie uses the same email/password she uses to register her daughter, she can view her roster, email her team, etc.<br>
</li>
<li>I think everyone has paid that is currently assigned to a team.  Ashley is listed as not paid for U14 but this is because she did pay for U18.  Let me know if I am missing something.</li>
<li>The U14 schedule has been added to the website</li>
<li>Gary: With U18 not happening can you work with Bill V. to cut a refund check for MacKenzie?  She is too old for U14.  Thanks.</li>
<li>What about the new board member request?  I think she would be a great addition to the board.  The request is in wecare inbox.  Thoughts?<br>

<li>9/9 works for me for the board meeting.  Any agenda items you want to add?  </li>
</ul><p><br></p><p><i>FROM GARY:</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>Happy Labor Day!</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>I wanted to bring you up to speed on the cost of the Stoughton (U12,U10) league.  It appears I made a mistake, even after contacting the Director (Tony via text), which he confirmed, he did respond that it could be read it was for the league cost to be total of $150.  But his original email stated per team.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>Kevin also checked in on it with me to make sure it was not per team via basecamp, and I went by the recent text to Tony.  The cost is $150 per team, so $425 per team including umpire fees.  Right now we have 11 on U10 (pretty sure we will get to 13 this week, 2 more coming on with Coach Radley, which I will mention below), U12 is only 9, with 8 paid. </i></p><p><br></p><p><i>A couple of projections at this point, U10 at 13 players, U12 at 10, if all paid, would be $690.  a $160 deficit, $7 per player more will be needed.  This would be best case, as of right now, we have a $280 deficit, if no one else signs up.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>I think I should email U10 and U12 beginning of next week and let them know I made a mistake and it will be X amount ($) more for Fall Ball, what do you think.  Two factors to bring down the deficit, more players (as Kevin already caught), and games not played, the umpire fee is not uese.  We may not get all the games in.  There possibly be a $50 credit on the U14 side of the ledger at the end, which if all under Fall ball, it helps the deficit. </i></p><p><br></p><p><i>I am also assuming the dozen of balls each team needs we have in inventory.  I have asked Dana, but not confirmed yet.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>I clearly undershot the budget, and will can make a donation to the league at the end of Fall ball for the shortage.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>Coaching update- Lauren Radley is coaching U10. I added her to the roster and sent her a password to email her team.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>The U14 team has 9 as of the roster list, I spoke with Mark Ware and he is signing up Maggie, and believes he has one more.  Brian is also reaching out this week.  Schedule needs to be added, will try to get to it tonight.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>U10- has 11, with 1 more I know being added (coach Radley kid), and Coach believes she has 2 more that may register.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>U12- has 9 and working on adding.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>As of today, all coaches have been asked to reach out to their teams and confirm next weeks games and info or questions.</i></p><p><br></p><p><i>Thanks,</i></p><p><i>Gary</i></p>

          I am picking up my kids from school every day because of sports so I will be in W Rox and Dedham every day starting tomorrow.  I can pick up game balls at SuperFlash, what do we need? LMK and I'll call Chuck tomorrow.<br><br>As for the cost, I am totally fine with the league eating the cost.<br><br>I would vote yes for Calece Johnson for a few reasons. First I met her at the coaches night out at The View and I liked her and she had a positive experience coaching and second, personally, I like that she is a woman. I am not sexist by any stretch but we lost LJ and to replace her with another woman I think is great. We don't have very many females on the board for an all girls league.<br><br>LMK what if anything I can do to help out w/ Fall Ball.<br><br>I will call CU Hall tomorrow and book next Mon., 9/8 for our BOD meeting. Should we have another Exec mtg before Monday? I am available almost any night if yes.

          Thanks for adding the U14 schedule<br><br>Next week, I will look at total registrations, then total expenses, including fees, balls, etc, and see what it looks like.<br><br>On the U10 Fall team, it actually is Lauren, its Maggies daughter (prior marriage, think she is in her 20's, helped this summer, did a good job).  That is why I set her up and gave her a password.  If we put her back on roster, will that be good enough for her to get roster access?<br><br>I reached out to Bill on the refund and the umpire checks.<br><br>Karen, if you could order a the balls from Chuck, that would be great.  He usually has most sizes in stock.  We need 2 dozen of 12, and one dozen of 11.<br><br>I agree on the positive notes on CJ for the board.  Her and I had some discussions about 2 to 3 years ago, as we hoped she would join us, and timing was not right she said (she has been very supportive of the league).  Great addition, and I do agree about having more females represented as well (coaching even better).<br><br>9/9 works as well.  I am available sooner if need be for an EB as well.  Had 3 agenda items, you may already have.   <br><br>*CLINICS- Pitching/Hitting- Winter-Spring. I have a working outline for winter clinics and spring, and thought we could work on it as an eb, or present an outline at the meeting for someone to take ownership or further development.<br><br>*SUMMER BALL- Do we try a invite team, or a A team, then everything else is just plain travel.  The A team is Travel and Tournament.  Is U18 a staple for next year? Can Milton have Summer programs similiar to other towns that have Tournament and Travel co-existing. (some of these items are more EB discussion). Agenda for Monday could be tryout dates, and do we retool it.<br><br>*SCOREBOARD- I have more detailed analysis for scoreboard.<br><br>*FALL BALL- update and cost mistake I made.

          2 dozen 12" and 1 dozen 11" softballs--I am picking them up at SuperFlash today. I can contact the coaches for them to pick them up at my house or is there something more convenient? LMK<br><br>SuperFlash has the Championship sweatshirts available from the Spring league. I will pick those up today as well. Should I contact Mark Ware and give them to him? How are these handled?

          Yes, have them pick up from your house.  <br><br>And you can have Mark swing by and grab the sweatshirts.  He will probably be there within 45 seconds of your call!!!<br><br>Can you take a picture of the front and back of one before he grabs them?  They have the new logo :)<br><br>THANK YOU!

          I picked up 3 dozen softballs and emailed the coaches. Attached are the images for the sweatshirts, they came out nice with dark green ink and lace. I emailed Mark too.

          Thank you.  Looks good.<br><br>I think the coaches may be okay with the score books - at least for now.  You could tell them to let us know if they need one.

</ul><br>General Board Meeting--Scheduled for Mon., 9/9 at 7pm at CU Hall. Kevin if you send out the agenda ahead of time I won't send out a reminder if you don't I will send one out on Sunday. See you both Monday night.
