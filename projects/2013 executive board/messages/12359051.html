    <h2>Coaches Shirts</h1>

    Spoke with Chuck and he can print on the performance shirts (same as last year). The shirts that Kevin and I were looking at are not the same shirts that we got last year. What we got last year was from Charles River Apparel and the models are 3810 for men and 2810 for women. They do not have a shirt with black in it, just the red and white. The cost online is $28/shirt. Right now with all the coaches and BOD members we are at a quantity of 26 so we are looking at $728. I think we should spend the money and get them, very professional looking and the quality of the shirts looks good. In addition they have women's cut shirts.<br><br>Here is the photo although you both probably can look in your closet.<br><br>I told him that I would send the order to him tomorrow morning and that the team uniforms is first priority.<br><br>I have compiled the list of coaches and I am only missing a few so I can reach out again tonight or just place the order and order a few late. LMK your thoughts please.

          You mention the model and the pic, which looks to be the same as last year, but mentinoed you are not going with last year, sorry, I might be missing something.  You mentioned no black and that confused me as well.

          Kevin and I were looking at a new shirt that had black in it (like the sball uniforms) and I don't have the photo on Basecamp.<br><br>The shirts that we ordered last year is the photo above and has NO black on them. I think they are fine.<br><br>Do you want to go with something new or what we had last year?Â

          I updated the order this morning, we have one outstanding coach that KO and GK have to talk about before I order a shirt...Mark Ware for U14 West. Please let me know the decision after you talk and I can update Chuck to order a shirt or not. Thank you.<br><br>KO...I will tell Chuck to talk to you about logo colors.
