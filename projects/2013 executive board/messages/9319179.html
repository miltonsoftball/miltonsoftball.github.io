    <h2>Spring Junior Coaches</h1>
    <p>Posted by Kevin Olivieri on March  6, 2013</p>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    This is from my earlier post about Junior Coaches.  Eric Kelly has confirmed he is returning.  So we have the following returning coaches:<br><ol>
<li>Eric Kelly - returning</li>
<li>Michael Kinsella—returning</li>
<li>Dan Rose/Ted Carroll—returning</li>
<li>Rich Shea/Hugh Kelly—returning</li>
</ol><br>The following are moving up and would like a team:<br><ul>
<li>Mike Papile/Mark Garuffi/Brian Possi—moving up</li>
<li>Bill Vaughn/Bob McCarthy/Rulon—moving up</li>
<li>Dana Rundlett—moving up </li>
</ul>We have planned for 6 teams x 13 players a team = 78 players.  We currently have 75 players.  It's unlikely we can support 7 teams at 13 player = 91 players.  I think 12 per team is too little at this level (and I am not sure we would have 84 girls).  Who has seniority from the three above?  Could anyone team up with Mike or Eric?<br><br>Thoughts?

          Both of you make some good points about Eric and Dana teaming up but ido we need to also look at this by seniority?  I am not sure how you tell Eric that now he has to "share" a team that he has been coaching.  And I also think Dana would be first of the three if you look at the number of seasons coached.  Dana has been coaching for a while and he also gets credit for coaching summer for several times.   <b>Gary</b> - you may be able to confirm as you have a better memory than I do on these things.<br><br>What do you think?

          If we go by seniority then my vote would be anyone that coaches last year should get that same team. Anyone moving up should be rated by seniority by the number of times they have coached (again my vote would be one tally per season spring or summer). I think this is the fairest thing to do. Gary, what are your thoughts?<br>PS<br>I LOVE using Basecamp!

          Karen, I like that, it does help the issue, its thin, but it may work.  In the past the seniority has worked if there is a team open we would look at who is moving up as coaches and first consider the tenure of each coach for the number of spots.<br><br>The issue with what Karen posted, is we technically have 4 returning coaches, which would leave 2 new coaching positions.  It is important to note, in the beginning, the heaviest weighting went to length of coaching, then in the past (few years) we have considered feeback, issues, summer coaching.<br><br>On pure tenure, It would first be Bob McCarthy, he has been coaching longer than Dana.  I believe Mike Papile and Dana both started coaching in 09, and Dana did summer in 11 (maybe 2010, but I dont think so).<br><br>I do consider it important how Papile has recruited more help each year and developed more coaches, and I think Dana has been to solo, both spring and summer.<br><br>I think we probably combine Papile and Rundlett to take the 6th team, and the assistants will fit in depending on which coaching style wins.  Garuffi was new last year and was helpful (parade, etc), Possi is not an overly active assistant and will assume any role.<br><br>Thoughts??<br><br>One aside....Eric Kelly great guy, but very solo as well.  Heard commitment dropped off last year (difficult family issue, work, etc....lets not forget he lost his wife 2 yrs ago).  I do think he needs to bring on help, but he likes to instruct his way and can be an asset if used, if he steps up. (Kev, you might know more on him).  Do we ask Eric if he wants to share head with Dana? (maybe not, just throwing it out)

          In thinking about this some more, I don't think you disrupt the Papile/Garufi/Possi team and likewise I think McCarthy/Vaughan/Rulon get the other nod.<br><br>I think we take the two independent styles of Kelly and Rundlett and have them work together.  We should discuss how we position it.  Does Eric run it and Dana helps out?  Dana becomes the head coach next year.<br><br>What do you think?

          I like that idea.  I agree, its probably how its approached.  With Dana on the board and involved it would be great to see what he wants, if he is okay with it or really wants a team.  Kev, your awesome at that delicate stuff.....good luck...lol

          I spoke to Dana this morning and explained the situation to him. He really would like his own team and is confident that he'll have parents to help him assist. He seemed pretty adamant and I didn't want to push it.

          Bob McCarthy has the most seniority over everyone, if there is only one team avaialble it would be his.

          Ok, first chance at a computer today, will give you a call.  Also looked over the numbers which you already have sliced, but its interesting to note we had 96 kids with 8 teams in Junior Division last year.  I think we are at 77 as of today.  I know we talked about capping at 78, but it seems to be a big drop off from last year (but that 6th grade class had been a bulge since the beginning, its more back to our mean), and wondering, will we have any more 4th graders wanting to move up, and any late signups, we should probably cap it at 84, which would be 7 teams of 12.  <br><br>So we have 6 teams right now, with 5 returning coaches; Kinsella, Eric K, Dan Rose, Rich Shea, Rulon.  Leaving one spot open, it does work out well that we put McCarthy and Vaughn with Rulon (they said no problem), and Dana gets his team (and he should get Papile, Grufu kids maybe, in that way he has coaches to help him instead of seeking out).  I have not spoken to Mike P. on interest.  I was not sure, I thought you or Karen may have sent out to all last years coaches a note, awhile back?

          My general feeling and experience is that very few girls want to move up.  They want to play with their friends.  <br><br>I took from our meeting Sunday that Rulon was not staying on to head coach but would instead help with a team. Does this mean he "technically" is keeping a team. Have you had conversations with Bob M, Bill V and Smokey?  <br><br>I have not spoken to any Junior coach except when I texted Mike K. during our meeting and he confirmed he is staying at the Junior Level.<br><br>Call when you can.

          Heard back from Mike Papile.  He seems to think it may be a good outcome.  Is checking with Garufi and Possi to see if they require to all stay together, but he will get back to me on being Mike Kinsella asst.  (I can break it to Mike later)

          The coaches for Junior appear to be set based on Gary's follow-up with Mike Papile. Here is what we have:<br><ol>
<li>Eric Kelly - returning</li>
<li>Michael Kinsella—returning  (assisted by Mike Papile/Mark Garuffi/Brian Possi)</li>
<li>Dan Rose/Ted Carroll—returning</li>
<li>Rich Shea/Hugh Kelly—returning</li>
<li>Smokey Rulon/Bill Vaughn/Bob McCarthy —returning</li>
<li>Dana Rundlett—moving up </li>
</ol><br>The roster assignments looks good.  I also made sure that for the most part teams where balanced between 5 and 6 graders.<br><br>I also looked at pitching data.  This includes innings pitched in 2012 as well as participation in the Level I and Level II pitching clinics we ran last spring.  The attached has this information marked.<br><br>All teams have at least 2 pitchers with various level of experience/age.  Take a look.  I'd love feedback by the early part of the weekend so I can begin to load rosters into the website.  Thanks!

          Not being pushy at all, my apologies, I could not open the excel doc at work today and could not complete the inquiry and work mentioned.<br><br>I agree we need to move forward, today was an important day to see if Denise Q would make sense to move, and I believe the league is better served with her not under the current team, just to many coaches, but we can make sure she is included if it stays that way.  I think it is a good move to the Rangers but I could not evaluate the balance for grades and the effect of friend pairing.<br><br>As mentioned in an email to Kevin, in placing roster players we should determine if we weigh what team they played in the prior division upon moving up and if that should override friend pairings.<br><br>I will say for the basecamp record, Kevin has put an amazing amount of time into this.  What Ray, Kevin, and I use to do, he has taken it to another level.
