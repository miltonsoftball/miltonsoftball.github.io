    Kev and Karen,<br><br>Anything you need for the coaches meeting tonight? I was wondering maybe in the future should we post the meeting dates on the website under Coaches corner. <br><br>Kev, are you bringing the cori sheets?<br><br>Karen, I dont think I have the most recent dates for all the upcoming meetings.  Is it possible to put them on the calendar on basecamp?  Between trying to confirm pitching clinics, coaching clinics etc, if you could send me what we have so far, that would be a help to me, thanks.  We have April 28th for Summer Evaluations, and Jr and Sr Coaches meeting next week.  Did we confirm the coaches clinic date?<br><br>Not sure who is checking wecare email?  What is the best way to login? Kev, did you send us a password?<br><br>I can get there early tonight, if you want help with anything, let me know.
