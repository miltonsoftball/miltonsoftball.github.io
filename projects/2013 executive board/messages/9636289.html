          Summer Tryouts-the 28th works-location will be Dirt Dawg.  Looking for them to help with evaluations, it will be for U10,U12,U14.  <br><br>Pitching clinics continue to be difficult to confirm and pin down. As of right now, we  are looking to have 3 clinics, one for each division.<br><br>The Sr division seems to be the most definite.-Location most likely Cunningham Pk<br>*Sunday April 28th-6pm<br>*Monday April 29th-6pm<br>*Monday May 6th-6pm<br>*Monday May 13th- 6pm<br><br>Senior clinic is 4 weeks for $60.<br><br>Soph and Jr Div- Hopefully Wed &amp;Thur April 3th/4th  @ 5:30 &amp; 6:30 and April 10th/11th, April 24th/25th.  It would be a 6 session pitching clinic, $90 per member.  Ten slots per hour, so 10 soph, 10 Jrs can sign up, and 10 Sr.<br><br>Having trouble booking and finding location with daylight.  First week of April may have to be indoors.<br><br>Kevin, could you send out another email to offer last change to sign up for clinics starting tomorrow?  Do you want to send one to coaches inviting them, or do you want me to.<br><br>On cell for next couple of hrs (3:30 pm sunday)<br>

          Thanks for the info.  The leagues schedules are complete and ready for review.  I would like to upload them Monday night so we have them in place for the meetings.  Would love your feedback.<br><br>Per our discussion Mondays have been left open for clinics and makeups.  Fridays are fairly open too  (see attached).  The Wed and Thu (24th and 25th) are booked with games across all divisions.  It's tight to try to move them - could you move the pitching to Friday?  Could you reduce the sessions to 4?<br><br>In terms of Summer, Sunday the 28th has been left wide open for all U-levels - except for a junior game and senior game at 5pm.  Let me know the schedule so we can get the word out and get an initial head count regarding interest.<br><br>Sure, feel free to email the coaches and send a reminder on the clinics.

          I spoke with Dave Perdios today on the permit and mysac meeting.  He has the request in for the lights for those dates, but wants to wait to see National League schedule as well, and feels it will not be an issue, but will not know till next week or so.<br><br>We will be getting asked for Sunday am at gile field, I think by National LL, but not sure if its for the reason that Ray mentioned.<br><br>I also asked for some field time at Milton Academy as I know he has put in a request for baseball, he said he may get us a night, will keep us posted.<br><br>Checking over master schedule now, looks good, hard to read in this format vs on a calendar, its alot of work, nice job Kevin.  I am sure you have accounted for the Pierce plays, Cunningham socials and all that stuff, I forget all the different conflicts.<br><br>Pitching clinics will be before season starts, accept the Senior division, but still have not had luck with Jenelle (have been working on a new or additional instructor).  It has been a number of days with Jenelle of moving dates and her not getting back to me.<br><br>I remember an email on our new email account (wecare), I forget how to access it for we can help keep things up to date.  I had two women at the clinic tonight mention they sent emails.<br><br>Clinics went very well tonight, will update on clinics tab.

          Hello all -<br>The schedules have been imported into the website.  I did some spot-checks and made a few adjustments.  if either of you have time, can you do a little testing? Things to look for:<br><ul>
<li>Go to the Master Calendar and confirm that I did not double book a field (you will see games in pink if I did).</li>
<li>Make sure I did not schedule a game during a holiday (exception for one Jr game on Monday night of Memorial Day) or during a league event</li>
<li>Make sure no team has three games in three days</li>
<li>Make sure that the home games for each team are balanced (no team should have more than 1 extra home game than another team</li>
</ul>Thanks!

          Kevin...I tried looking at the list and I can't review it. So I am exporting the schedules by division and then color coding the teams. I have reviewed the Sr and Jr teams and I see problems with both BUT I don't know if I exported the schedules properly.<br><br>Can you call me at home so I can make sure I am exporting the schedules correctly. I can review all divisions this morning for you.

          I just proofed all divisions, here are the results:<br><br>No fields are double booked.<br><br>The only game for Memorial Day weekend is Jr Astros vs Giants, per request.<br><br>No teams have 3 games back to back on consecutive days.<br><br>This next section is LONG...<br><br>Fresh--12 teams each is playing 11 games (5 or 6 away/5 or 6 home),<br>everyone playing each team 1 time...perfect<br><br>Soph--7 teams each is playing 6 home and 6 away...perfect except:<ul><li>Blue Jays are playing Mariners and Padres 2x in a row</li></ul><ul>
<li>Dodgers are playing Tigers and Nationals 2x in a row</li>
<li>Rays are playing Nationals and Tigers 2x in a row</li>

          Thank you Karen!<br><br>I took your advice and tweak the juniors - so very few are playing 2x in a row.<br><br>Thanks for looking it over.  I think they look good.

          I just checked all the Jr teams that had conflicts and they look much much better. I say these are done!

          Excellent!  Thanks.<br><br>I had the wrong date for Mother's Day (it's 5/12).  I changed the games from 5/12 to 5/19 to account for this.  This presented a few issues with too many games in a row for 3 teams but I made the updates and I think it looks good.<br><br>All the schedules across all divisions are live. :)
