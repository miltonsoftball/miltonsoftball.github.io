    Thank you to both of you for the help with the board meeting last week.  Kev, the handout fo rthe committee's was great, and I am sure be a good tool going forward.  It should help channel some of the volunteers focus.<br><br>On that topic, you both probably realized how LJ jumped in and offered to help with clinics, basically after someone else offered earlier (maybe Karen for Uniforms, yes?).  I have reservations about this, but we do need to move forward for the winter clinics to take place.  LJ did send Kev and I an email, we need to discuss.<br><br>I thought the election for BOD was fine, and worked out adding Ted, he will be a very good asset (imo).  I touched base and called them all, Kev mentioned he has communication going out with the registration reminder, awaiting my contact to them, which is now done, thks for waiting.<br><br>Any thoughts on getting together for the EB, and tackle the to do list, basecamp, etc. or we can do it this way i guess.<br><br>I can check on securing space for clinics once we know direction,type, etc. dates.
