          Tables with chairs surrounding them would be great.  If they had a white projection screen it would be great, but not a requirement.  Thank you!

          Spoke with Ruth at CU Hall and tables will be set up with chairs around. I asked for 20 chairs and we can grab a few more if we need them.
