    Pitching clinics are late to put together, but with only 10 spots for each group, I think it still worth it.  Was waiting for a facility issue and cost.  We have secured free space at TJO, and Jenelle has confirmed the following.<br><br><div>Thur-April 4th     6:30-7:30  &amp; 7:30-8:30</div><div>Fri-April 5th     6:30-7:30  &amp; 7:30-8:30</div><div>Thur-April 11th    6:30-7:30  &amp; 7:30-8:30</div><div>Fri-April 12th     6:30-7:30  &amp; 7:30-8:30<br><br>Early session is for Soph, later is for Jr division.  It is a 4 session clinic, (2 each week), cost is $60.  Jenelle will be paid $150 per session.  I suggest we have a wait list up to 12, Jenelle may look at taking 12.<br><br>The catcher instructor I was working on, has work conflicts at this time, so we should consider doing a catchers clinic outside at some point.</div>

<li>Currently we have one Senior game on 4/28 at 5p and two Senior games on 5/5 at 5pm?   No games on Mondays - just practices.</li>
<li>Do you want to charge for the PayPal fee like we have in the past - i.e. total cost is $62.50?</li>
<li>Are we going to be strict per grade level (in other words should I force it in the registration?)</li>
<li>Can you throw some copy together for the email and for the registration page?</li>

          We could move those games to 3pm at Cunningham.

          Pitching clinic dates have been moved to give registration a chance to fill up.  Dates are April 11th and 12th, and April 25th, and 26th, same time, same location.  I realize there may be game conflicts, but that will have to work itself out.

          A reminder email was sent on Wednesday, 4/10 to all Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors encouraging them to sign up for the pitching clinics.<br><br>As you mentioned, we are paying Janelle $150 per session for a total of $1,800.  <br>If we do not fill all 10 slots, do we get stuck paying the difference?

          I believe we do, I did not anticipate not filling the clinics.  I will talk with her about the issue.  She was trying to charge $20 per player and came to an agreement on the $15.<br><br>Thank you for sending the email.

          Not sure if we look at combing the Soph/Junior groups.  Currently, that would mean 14 total.  May be too much for Janelle but it would be her call.  <br><br>Maybe she could open it up to her own list to fill in the rest?<br><br>It would be unfortunate to get stuck paying for the 6 empty spots.

          What about asking the coaches to promote the clinics to their pitchers? 14 seems like a very large number when she had requested only 10. As a parent I would prefer to pay more and get more attention for my child than pay less and get less. We could email the parents and say that there isn't enough interest would they be willing to pay more and maybe the league could pay some.<br><br>I don't know what the right thing to do is. What have we done in the past?

          We haven't had an issue before.  Part of it may be location and timing. <br><br>Janelle prefers 10 with a cap of 12.  If she had more help, maybe 14 would work.  But it's really up to her.<br><br>Seniors is only 5 but we have some time to work on that one.

          I will ask about combining them.  It s to late for other options.

          Scarborough is on the Senior Phillies with my Caitlin and she signed up today but is having a problem with PayPay. I told her to try another credit card or to send in a check so they may be 6. <br><br>When the coaches pick up the shirts tonight remind them to tell their players about the pitching clinic.
