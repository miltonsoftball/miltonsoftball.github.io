    As you know we have been discussing how to best store our equipment so we can keep it safe, clean and if possible, protect it from the elements.  After some follow-up conversations with Board Members, we investigated storage units at Extra Space Storage in Milton/Lower Mills.  We waited until a unit to our liking and needs opened up and this last weekend one did.<br><br>This will be a great place to house all equipment bags, extra equipment, banners, etc.  I understand this is a luxury for any league so if budgets get tight and we need to look at some cost saving measures, I think this will be the first to go.  <br><br>This will be a great place to have coaches pick up/drop off equipment as well as inventory all the bags in the off-season.<br><br>The monthly is just about $200 for a 10x10 unit.<br><br>Keypad access is 6500* (to get inside the building)<br>The unit is #82.<br>Combination for our unit is 0-30-35  (turn right once, turn left twice and turn right once)<br><br>
