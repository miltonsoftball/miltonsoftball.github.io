    Our coaching clinics are April 7th at Dirt Dawg.  The Freshman and Sophmore division coaches will be at 11am -12pm, the Jr and Sr division coaches is 12-1pm.  <br><br>Whatever you send out, we should encourage ALL coaches to attend.<br><br>As of right now, I will be focusing on the Freshman and sophomore division to work with Dirt Dawg on the content.  I have asked Ted Carroll to ask me with that as well.  The Jr and Sr division content we already have  most of what we want to be covered (as in past coaches clinics).

          We have Dirt dawgs reserved for this Sunday for 2 hours, for the coaches clinics.  They will run them, along with any input or format our league wants to add.  If you both have suggestions or what we should cover, I can let them know.  Kevin, you may want to run this clinic with them if you have anything specific as a league goal, or we can let them know to cover it.<br><br>Not sure how you want to inform/remind the coaches.<br><br>Karen, good luck on your first road race!  Is that a warm up for the marathon the following week.

          I am open to ideas.  I know you have had this on the radar for a while so I am happy to hear your thoughts.  Did the DD staff have any ideas/feedback when you spoke to them about these sessions?

          I would make sure that DD knows this is a recreational league and meant for instruction not competition and to reiterate that to the coaches. As for specifics I would love for the coaches to get some direction on how to how to coach/talk to the girls in a positive way (you can take anything negative and turn it around and make it a goal for the girl to improve) and b) proper mechanics. I am sure a bunch of these coaches (majority are males) coach baseball and softball is different.<br><br>Gary...1/2 marathon goal is for 2014, this is my 1st 5K!

          I am thinking about doing a survey to the coaches about the coaches clinic last Sunday.  Anything you want to include?  Can you get me any questions you'd like to include by Saturday?  I plan to send the survey out over the weekend.  Thanks.

          Great idea! I would get the list of topics we said would be coverered and ask them if those topics were covered. I would also ask what they thought was missing for future clinics.
