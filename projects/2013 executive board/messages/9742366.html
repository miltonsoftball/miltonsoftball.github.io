    I came home and talked to Mitch about a fair way to draft players (not taking into consideration pitchers) and he has been in Fantasy Football for years. The way they do it is you get assigned a blind draw so if there are six teams 1-6 would be assigned. First round 1 goes first, 2 goes second, and so on. Second round 6 goes first, 5 goes second, and so on. Third round 1 goes first, 2 goes second, and so on. At first I was thinking this wasn't fair because 1 and 6 have an advantage and Mitch's reply was do you want the best and worst or do you want most of the middle players.<br><br>Something to think about.

          Okay my mind is spinning on how to make this fair, another option would be to pull a number from a bag 1-6. First round, 1 goes first, 2 goes second, and so on. Second round, 2 goes first, 3 goes second, and so on. Third round, 3 goes first, 4 goes second, and so on. Fourth round, 4 goes first, 5 goes second, and so on.

          Hi all -<br><br>I worked on the data collection for the senior draft.  What I have so far is attached.  I still need to add Summer info and Jr coaching evals.<br><br>You will also notice we do not have any data on the returning 8th graders from the Senior Athletics or the Senior Phillies.  (Gary- do you want to evaluate the former Athletic 8th graders?)<br><br>The calculations also need to be added as well but you will get a sense of all the data points we have.<br><br>I also took a stab at identifying pitchers.  I judged the 8th graders from what I remember.  The 7th graders received an "x" is they pitched 10+ innings. We may want to fine tune this.  Maybe add a column for tier 1 pitchers and list the top 12?  This way we can separate them from the rest of the draft.<br><br>Feel free to review.  For version control, let's talk about how edits will be provided so we all don't go crazy making sure we have the latest one.<br><br>Let's try to wrap this up by Friday so we can communicate the process to the clients.  Excel and PDF attached (both the same) <br>

          Good news is that you have identified 16 girls who pitched last year.<br><br>Questions for us to think about:<ul>
<li>Do we want to make the assumption that they will be pitching this year?</li>
<li>Do we take into consideration how the team did last year?</li>
<li>Do we take into consideration if they won the Championship game (and pitched in the game)?</li>
</ul><br>I think creating 2 levels of pitchers is a good idea and let's look at that data before we say that we will distribute that data to the coaches.

          <b>In terms of Team Evaluations</b><br>Multiple emails went to Rusty at the end of last season and I know he has a lot going on so I never pushed.  But the feedback was never completed.  If you feel you are close enough to the roster, I would suggest you do it.  Otherwise, feel free to ask Rusty.  <br><br><b><u>Redrafting</u></b><br>I am sure the re-drafting will work out.  I feel we do not need to outline the reasons for realignment.  We have already been down that path over a year ago.  The Exec Board of Ray, you and I decided that we would blow up the teams and redraft after this season.  We debated doing it last season but pushed it off to 2013 for three reasons: 1. with the realignment happening we didn't want to cause more confusion. 2. Girls had already registered and we felt it would not be fair to let them know that we are redrafting AFTER they had registered; and 3. With so many veteran coaches returning last season, we decided that it would be best to wait when there would be more fresh coaches in the mix. <br><br>The decision to redraft was not taken lightly.   This initiative was communicated to the board in 2012 and it was also outlined in the 2013 Spring Registration process.  <br><br>So.. it's less about the why and more about the how.  Let's focus out effort on the <b><i>how</i></b>.<br><br><u><b>Timing</b></u><br>With the draft a week away and Karen's unavailability this weekend, as an Eboard need to work efficiently over the next 3 days to develop a fair and clear draft process.  Will it be perfect?  No.  But it will be fair and backed up with our thinking. <br><br>We will communicate the draft process to the 6 Senior coaches <b>by Friday night/Saturday morning</b>.  This will give them some time to understand it and prepare for it. <br><br><b><u>Next Steps<br></u></b>With the draft list and data, I think we can comfortably state that we have enough <u>strong</u> pitching for one round (and possibly 2).  <br><b><u><br></u></b><ol>
<li>
<b>Assistant Coaches</b><br>I would like to suggest that each of you - Gary and Karen - respond to this thread and provide your POV on assistant coaches.  The options are:<br>-  Coaches select an assistant coach prior to the draft<br>- Coaches cannot pre-select a assistant coach and will take their chance getting the assistant of their choice during the draft.  <br>- Other?  Open to ideas<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Draft order</b><br>There are endless ways to do this.  Karen submitted a few.  I mentioned Ray's idea of R1: 1-6, R2: 2,4,6 R3 1, ,3, 5 and R4 6-1 and then start back at 1-6 for R5.  There are others we can consider as well.   What would be your recommendation?</li>
</ol><br>After we receive your feedback on the above, we can discuss how to rate/rank kids, how to handle the siblings (there are 2-3 of them), etc.<br><br>Thanks for your efforts.  <br>

          I agree, the how is where we need to be.  So my question is, are we looking for total parity?  If so, one out side the box idea, could be a blind draft.   The coaches would draft and create teams that are as equal in ability as possible, and then the teams will be assigned at <b>random</b> to the coaches.  I could go into more detail if intrigued  but the coaches are creating the teams, and they do not know whether they are creating their own team or one they will have to compete against.  They would have great incentive to use all their knowledge and strategy to create teams that are as equal as possible.<br><br>Other thoughts- On pitching, as we identify pitching candidates prior to the draft, it might make sense to just identify the number of pitchers to be equal to the number of teams (i.e. Six pitchers).  The six best pitchers would be identified and rated on a scale of 1 to 5, or 1 to 3 with the high number being the best.  This will help populate the draft for other resources, which maybe we could now do the same for catchers, or look to see if we have 6 catchers.  This would also allow more position players in the draft pool.<br><br>If we conduct the draft with designated best pitchers (and/or) best catchers, all other players we can designate as position players.<br><br>Can we get on the same page for the rating of the players (ie. we are utilizing input from the prior coaches, you and me, yes? is that info or data we can look at), which looks to be a scale of the averages, which is a good idea, below, above, excellent, right?  And the overall abilities to consider are hitting, fielding, and throwing?  We should have a rating of unrated in case we have no info on a girl as well.<br><br>Are you okay with putting numerical numbers or a scale of 1-4 as well, beside the averages scale?  We could use them as rating point values of the players and each team can be tallied to keep track of the relative strength of each team, if so, I have some ideas or suggestions on using that RS and total point value as stronger team, weaker team which can determine certain draft guidelines.<br><br>To your questions on Asst Coaches, if a blind draft can be considered, asst coaches are not factored in, they would not know which team they are going to get.  As you mentioned, coaches select an assistant or cannot pre-select.  A third to be considered is a coach pairing done by the draft coordinator (in this case, us).  This could be done by informing the coaches, they do not have an option of selecting their assistant coach, and we ask them all to help the Draft coordinator to identify all potential Assistant coaches.  One thing this may do, is to identify actual assistant coaches, for the coordinator to pair coaches.   We need 6 assistant coaches, we may be able to help pair and help equilibrium of talent and assistants across the board, <br>If we tell the coaches, Assistant coaches will be paired by the Draft coordinators, please submit any coaches name that they may know that would like to assistant coach,  knowing they may end up coaching any team (similar to our 4th grader playing up).  We can then evaluate the pool of assistants, along with checking with them as well.  (Mitch is a good example, as an assistant, he would end up with either Brink, Toyias, or Carroll, based on our pairing.  Then do we know, would he still help assist knowing he may be with Toyias or Carroll?  In this case btw, this is why we would want to see who the top 6 designated pitchers are, based on 1-6.  Looking at the pitching data, I did not see summer 2012 marked off on anyone.  I dont see 6 girls that pitched this summer, which is just a guide to me of what level they have pitched at. <br><br>On the draft order, I agree, multiple ways, but to start the first round it is as easy as all others, draw numbers from a hat or some other random basis.  This would be for the round robin, after the head coach, assistant coach players are assigned.<br><br>The first round will be used to draft one of the designated best pitchers (6), if a team already has one of those best pitchers because of daughter of head or assistant  the team would not select.  We could play this out for the second round to draft one of the designated best catchers (6).  If the team already has one of those best catchers because of coaching, the team would not select in 2 nd round.  This is where we could use the rating point values.  The order of selecting catchers in the second round would be based on the strength of the pitcher selected (appointed/coaches kid) by each team in the first round.  A team with a lower rated pitcher from the first round would select before a team with a higher rated pitcher. (ex- a team with a pitcher rated a 2 will select before a team with a pitcher rated 3, we could break any ties by drawing a number from a hat or the random basis we used to start the round robin).<br><br>More to follow depending on if we want to look at that route.  This could have trades available once the draft is complete.  It would be based on both coaches being in agreement with making the trade (once).<br><br>One thought I think we should consider, if feasible, is a pre draft coaches meeting to evaluate the players (the rating process we are doing) which would give more of a equal footing to all coaches instead of those in the know, or more experienced (summer, etc).  A informational meeting on evals may be helpful and level the gamesmanship.<br><b><br></b>

<b>Gary</b> - great post.  So… the $10,000 question: where do you stand on the Assistants?  What is your vote?</div><div><br></div><div>I will wait for Karen's POV but here are some comments and additional info:</div><div><br></div><div><u><b>Draft Type</b></u></div><div>The blind draft idea is interesting.  Dedham has used it in the past and it was successful in that it achieved balance but it was not liked by the coaches.  You are spot on that coaches draft differently but for 5 out of the 6 coaches who have never been part of a draft before, their lack of experience may not work in the league's favor of achieving balance.  That being said, if you or Karen feel strongly about it we should discuss.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pitchers</b></div><div>
<b>Gary</b> - Can you take a shot at listing the top 6 pitchers in your opinion/based on the data and then rate them using the scale you outlined? It will help me understand what it will look like.  I am not sure if two pitchers can have the same rating or if we are ranking the 1 thru 6.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Catchers</b></div><div>
<b>Gary</b> - can you take a shot at identifying catchers and see if we can come up with 6?</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ratings/Data</b></div><div>You may have missed it earlier in the thread but I have not added Summer and Junior evals to the document yet.  It's on my list.</div><div><br></div><div>The rating descriptions were supplied by the coaches.  For the past few years we have translated the description into a 1-5 scales and the FHT Scale is this average.  We can alter the formula anyway we want.</div><div><br></div><div>The pre meeting is an interesting idea but I may be too late considering that it's March 20th.  Ted Carroll isn't even sure he can come to the draft meeting.  And trying to get this group together twice may be a tough task.  If you feel strongly about this pre-meeting, we need to move on it immediately.</div>

          Before I forget, was it Emma Kelley that Coach Ware was trying to align assistant strategy for?  How do we vette that out?  <br><br>Have you heard back from Meg Toyias?<br><br>So far we have some coaches that know the game, and have asked for an assistant, align for an assistant or position for one.  I think we should take the step of emailing the 6 coaches and let them know we are developing the draft guidelines and at this time we are not accommodating assistant coaching request, but are making sure we identify all that are interested.  We use the registration form (which is not a good source to use, imo, most do not know the weight of the assistant coach role, to list themselves as an assistant), the website, and I think we have had input from this years coaches, but not all coaches know that.<br><br>If we get out in front to identify potential now, we can draw a better stand if we are approached nearing draft time, of the convenient  I forgot but Jim Kapolis said he will help me!  <br><br>I think we can then draft our rule by looking to see if we have 6 that would help give us some parity, AND some matches that 70/80% might be happy.(orginial expcectations)<br><br>Will be back on the $10,000 question......and your other good questions.  I can not select the best out of current list with out seeing more data.

          <br><b>Draft idea- </b>I was liking this until you mentioned Dedham.....which seems like the rec league has died for some reason.  All kidding aside, this may need more testing, this may work, even with new coaches, it may actually help, they are all at the same starting point, which is rare,they all have the same opportunity, try to draft and build the best roster, not knowing who is going to get it.  Less strategy actually is involved from an experience point of gamemanship.  <br><br>Since we are blowing it up to this point of erasing all past history, it may make sense, and certainly more parity!  I wonder what the coaches in dedham did not like about it? Probably not having control of your picks to influence your own destiny.  Ending up with a team picked for me, I get, would not be the feeling of its mine.<br><br><b>Pitchers/catchers- </b>Will do my best to see if can identify best 6 of each.  Sorry,I did miss that thread on the summer data comment, Is there a way I can look at last years rosters and get data on who caught, I know the pitching data is there).  Summer would help me to take a look at, I will go look at last summers rosters and figure out who pitched.<br><br><b>Ratings</b>- I agree it is tough to get them together, but this may be an important precedent set for the new changes and work being done on the draft.  It may go along way to giving the coaches the chance to become better informed.  As you mentioned, with 5 of 6 being new at this, the regular draft will be overwhelming enough, maybe?  But I get the tight timeline.

          We don't have any hard data on who caught.<br><br>We have done a ratings score in the past few drafts - essentially a weighted score based on the coach's evaluation - and then as a group we would review each player and come to a consensus on the rating. <br><br>What you described in your post above seems to be different.  I want to understand your thinking about how we would come to this additional rank/rating?  What's the formula/data that goes into it?  Would it be replacing the one we have been using? Is the end goal to rank highest to lowest based on this new metric?

          To be honest, I am overwhelmed and a little lost and I think part of it is because I am confused and part of it is that I have not been through a draft before. With that said, although the idea of drafting a team that you don't know if it will be your or not is somewhat appealing I don't like the idea. I am leery of doing something that Dedham did because of the situation that they're in. My gut says no and I don't think that the coach will feel like it's "their team". Last, is every team is starting with a player (their own child and in Laurie's case with two players) so you do know at least one player. I think we should identify all the pitchers and rate them in two tiers and then have the draft for pitchers. I think we should rate the rest of the players in several tiers (maybe 2, 3 or 4 depending on the how many we're talking about). How teams pick should be random not based on last year, maybe pick a number from the hat or use Ray's method to execute. As for Assistants I am torn for several reasons. I will put aside my selfish intentions of where I would like Caitlin to go and suggest that the draft dictates who goes where and then the coach can figure out assistants. I am curious about Ray's opinion, have either of you asked him yet?<br><br>I am available off and on all day tomorrow. LMK what else we need to talk about.

          One more thing, if you want to see who caught you could probably go through the players with their older coaches and find out that data. At a minimum I could tell you from last spring and summer a few of the catchers. Whether girls want to catch this spring is a different matter.

          As noted, we do not have input from coaches on catchers, so I do not know how to give quantitative input on them.  Depending on the draft process, I was suggesting to see if we could look to see if we had 6 catchers to rank 1 thru 6 , best being 1.<br><br>The rating formula I was not looking to change what we have, as much as use the same data we have, like in the past, and the new metric would be for the pitchers, and catchers (if we do catchers), ranking the best pitchers 1-6, to see which team has what is considered the best.  Then this number is used in our quantitative process of creating a Relative Strength index (new), when we combine our FHT number and the pitcher number, gives us a RS number as we go through the draft to try to balance out the RS number, and can also guide draft guidelines.<br><br>I will be able to draw up an outline on what I am suggesting, but it will not be until this evening.<br><br>My vote on the assistants is to first see if the draft coordinator (us) can assign from the known pool of assistants.  Is it safe to say we now have all input from the 6 head coaches on known assistants?  And on that note, the feedback you are getting from the coaches, might be helpful to shape our decision.  The names listed above I guess is complete unless you received more names.  Has Jensen and Conroy given feedback on who they are looking for to assist?

(I am not a proponent of recreating the wheel.)<br><br>Assistants--If after rating all the pitchers and asst coaching requests you think everyone would have comparable talent on their teams I say grant the requests but if not we shouldn't and the draft will have to dictate where people go.<br><br>Talk later.

          Hi all -<br><br>Attached is a word document that is a draft of the draft process I would like to send to the Senior Coaches.  The document outlines the process and takes into consideration our discussions over the past few days.  <br><br>The draft order was an important part of this document and to show you the thinking, I attached an excel file that lists 6 different draft scenarios and showing the average draft pick of each team.  The average is listed based on the entire draft as well as the first 4 rounds and the first 5 rounds (after which the talent tends to drop off).    This is just for reference but hopefully it will help you see how the recommended draft order was selected.<br><br>Feedback is welcome.  The goal is to send this out to coaches on the early part of Saturday so if you can comment, please do by Saturday morning.  I am happy to discuss if you have questions.

          Questions and comments:<br><br>Why are we only listing 6 pitchers? I looked at the "2013_Senior_Div_DraftBoard_03202013" file and there are 16 girls that are listed as pitching last year. Would it make more sense to list the top 12 pitchers and have the top 6 in round 1 and the next 6 in round 2? The remaining 4 would go into the regular draft with a note that they have pitched in the past. That way every team would end up with 2 pitchers on a team (first two draft picks). Then have the catchers be the third draft pick.<br><br>I listed where their team ended up at the end of the season as well as who pitched in the championship game and if they won. If you want that data LMK and I will retype it here for you.<br><br>I just read the document (fast) and it looks good, I will read it again and reply if I have any other comments.

          Thanks for your feedback.<br><br>I think after the top 6, the talent level of pitching drops a lot.  The rankings become so close... differing by mere hundredths so it's hard to rank one above the other.<br><br>Just because someone pitched at the junior level at 35' does not equate success at 43' in senior.  We could extend pitching another round but I am not sure it will have as much as an impact.<br><br>If you feel the data is helpful, feel free to send it along.  The challenge is trying to level it.  Is an average pitcher for a last place team in seniors better than a pitcher who pitched at 35 feet in a championship game?  How to value (i.e. rank) one over the other?  The data is sometimes qualitative vs. quantitative.

          I guess what I was thinking is that you don't want one or two teams to not end up with 2 pitchers... I guess if pitchers are first round and cathers are second round it's the responsibility of the coach to pick up another player that pitches in their third round.

          You are absolutely correct about qualitative data vs quantitative data! If the data is that far apart I agree with only listing the top 6 pitchers.<br><br>Before Wednesday night I would like to understand how everyone is rated and the formula and the data behind it. I don't need specific names just the process and some examples so I can make sure I understand the ratings.

          This may be a dumb question, but it just occurred to me, did we notify (not that we needed to) the registration (8th graders) that the Sr division will be a totally new draft and all players go into the draft and not to expect to be on the same team as last year (or friends)?

          First of I would like to commend Kevin on a fantastic job on this work for the draft, the doc is great Kevin, nicely done, and will help continue to shape it.<br><br>Secondly,  the assigning of pitchers is still new, in the past we made sure they had pitching, but I do not believe it was assigned first.  This being new, and with the process of position players being both decent to average pitchers, but as good or better in position, I do believe its best to try the new idea of at least making sure the top 6 are identified and assigned a number.<br><br><br><b>Catchers- </b>Kev,, sorry, I did mention I would help list catchers &amp; pitchers. Will defer to what you have unless input is needed.<br><br><b>Email to coaches-</b> Great email to the coaches, letting them know at this time we are not accommodating assistant request.  Now that we vetted that out (no luck with response, but its been asked), do we let them know, IF the procedure of assistants (or the procedure may be) assigning assistants to each team, and if you have not given us a selection to consider, when you draft, the child may not be on the board because they have been assigned as assistant/player?<br><br>The goal here is to basically see if we can match up who they want and at least get 80% of it right, (4 teams would be a higher % than if we leave it to the other process, is my guess, or hope).  So in theory, if we have 6 coaches, and we can find out the following, it may get us closer to the goal.<br><br><b>Coach-   Assistant (request or likes)<br></b>Brink= Lewis<br>Jensen=?<br>Conroy=?<br>Ware=?<br>Toyias=?<br>Carroll=?<br><br>From the list noted above, I am wondering if we can find out if Jensen wants Bernardi, or Conroy wants D'Amato.  We know Foley, Garninder, are not assistants, who is Tangney a potential with?  <br><br>If we look at the top 8 prospects after the pitchers are assigned, we are looking at; (non- committed)Gardiner, Hiller, Kapolis, Kelly, Brown,Carey, O'Toole, (only 7 I think i came up with).- No assistants in this group, except the mirage of O'toole.<br><br>This process may lead us to the fact that there are not assistants to be assigned, but if we consider using it as one of the draft guidelines, and you submit the name, we can assign, and people like Josh, get Lewis....not perfect, but it is viable.<br><br>Next thread will be on ratings.

          <br>Another comment as I look at catchers, and my prior mentioning can we or should we assign a catcher.   I think Kevin mentioned it is difficult because some of the better athletes will catch or have caught, but are not catchers.  I.E.-Kapolis, she has caught, shortstop, etc, but if we put her as catcher, you are taking the # 1 or # 2 kid and putting her as catcher to be picked in first round, since pitchers may already be slotted.  this may work in this case, but other cases maybe not.  Not sure of any solution to this issue.

          <br><b>Draft-</b> The guideline Kevin sent out (updated 3/22) is great. I think that can be the majority of what we need and tweak or add to it.  <br><br>I have attached a doc that is more for thought and addition or subtraction to the guidelines drafted.  <br><br>The Relative strength index or metric could be something to work on, and fun to maybe incorporate a piece of it, either after,  or before.<br><br>We can stay with the 1-5 metric, no need to go to 1-3, and still use relative strength, it would just be a higher value.<br><br>We should decide if we can do a 2nd round for catchers, or let if just be 1st round for pitchers.<br><br>Its good to see trades as an option, one we will not promote, but lets make the rule, any trades have to be done that night and are final.

          To answer your question, parents and players were informed of the redrafting in registration.<br><br><p>It looks like from your list that we cannot find 6 catchers.  I tend to agree.  One of them is Brink who is also a pitcher and can't be "counted" twice.  I am not sure how strong Johnson is either.  I do not think we can with confidence find 6 catchers that are worthy of being part of a separate draft.  As much as I hate to, I think it needs to come out of the draft document.  If either of you disagree, let me know.  I just don't see the numbers to support it.<br></p><p><br></p>
<p>Can you work up the formula in Excel for the relative strength index you outlined in the document?  I am not sure how that will work or be calculated.    Are we taking the F-H-T and adding them together for each player on a team?</p><p><br></p><p>There are several sections that are repetitive to what I already have in the document I sent.  Are you suggesting we replace these sections?  Feel free to edit the word doc I sent if you feel some parts should be replaced or edited   Having it in two documents is tough to follow.  I noticed that most of your document is from Mansfield's website:</p><p><a href="http://www.mansfieldgirlssoftball.com/pdf%20files/DraftProceduresv6.pdf">http://www.mansfieldgirlssoftball.com/pdf%20files/DraftProceduresv6.pdf</a> so is it only the items in red what you are recommending?</p>

          I agree, the numbers on the catchers are not there.<br><br>I can work up something on excel.  It is from the mansfield stuff.  Similar to your doc, I was just outlining things, which you may have already had in your doc, was not looking to replace anything, just see what it is best combination.<br><br>I reached out to the teams in the Hoc league on how they conduct their drafts, which lead to the only interesting information.<br><br>I wanted to see if it makes since to do a relative strength metric, I like the idea of having a team weighting, but I get the feeling it might be best to use it next year as we improve upon things
