    <b>Update on the Freshmen Coaches</b><br>I emailed the parents of the Freshman players soliciting coaches and was inundated with responses.  VERY GOOD THING!  I think we will should be fine with coaches and we have plenty of assistants.  <br><br>I started assigning players to teams and one hiccup is 18 players who are somehow tied to the Freshwomen Athletics (Karimbakas/Mullen/Walsh).  I emailed the three of them to help me prioritize.  The rest of the players will be assigned based on that.  It looks like we will have 12-13 teams.  This is a revised estimate from Sunday's meeting.<br><br>No need to follow up wit Rooney and Harrington.<br><br>I'll send around the assignments when it's ready.

          GREAT news! I think it's a great idea to ask the coaches to help you prioritize and ask those if they would like to split up as well.

          Wow, thats great, up to 13 teams possibly, is that with an average of 10 per team, we have jumped from 117 to almost 130?

          The freshwomen assignments are on hold until I hear back from the coaches who have 18 players who want to play for them (or with friends already on the team).  Once I get that info, I should be able to send the Freshmen list for review.<br><br>I have 12 confirmed coaches.  I am not pursuing a 13th right now.  We are at 122 registrations.

          Okay, the rosters for the Freshwomen Division are complete and are attached for your review.  Look at the Assignments tab and if you want to dig deep you can cross reference by looking at the Pair List Tab.<br><br>Upon your reviews/approvals, I will assign players to teams.  Thanks.

          Lots of issues:<br>Angels<ul>
<li>Mae McKenna, I don't see her on the master list of names, was she added last minute?  <i><b> - YES, she was a late registration.</b></i>
</li>
<li>Ava Robertson wanted to be with Grace Henry (Orioles)  -<b><i> I moved Ava to Orioles with Grace.  The coach of Orioles asked if Grace could be on the team.</i></b>
</li>
<li>Molly Shea wanted to be with Grace Henry too  - <b><i>Moilly's dad is coaching Angels so she needs to stay there.</i></b>
</li>
</ul>Pirates<ul><li>Avery McNeely wanted to be with Olivia Beattie (Orioles) - <b><i>Dad is now a coach, so this request is no longer valid.</i></b>
</li></ul>Orioles<ul><li>Olivia Beattie wanted to be with Avery McNeely (Pirates) -<i><b> both are coaching so this can't work.</b></i>
</li></ul>Red Sox<ul>
<li>Maggie Renaud and Isabella Goonan wanted to be with Kate Karimbakas (A's) <b><i>- yes, this is part of the earlier issue I had with the A's.  They had 18 girls who wanted to be on the team.  Unfortunately, I had to limit the A's to 11 and based the names from a list from the coach.</i></b>
</li>
<li>Katherine Drozdick wanted to be with Caroline Driscoll (A's)  <b><i>Yes, but Caroline wanted to be with Rhodes (returning player to A's), and the team doesn't have enough room.</i></b>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>Brynne Mershon and Alexis Yankun wanted to be with Maggie O'Brien - <b><i>This is an issue with no more room on the A's.  </i></b>
</li></ul><br>Rachel Jones-Booker is not assigned to any team. - <b>Good catch.  Apparently I didn't do a good job checking my math. <br><br>Updated document attached.</b>

          Just reviewed all  your comments as well as the new spreadsheet and everything looks great. Your numbers were correct but when you added Mae McKenna and you didn't add Rachel Jones-Booker to a team the numbers were still correct. Regardless I think it all looks great.<br><br>2 down and 2 to go!

          <b>Freshwomen have been assigned teams in the website.<br></b><br>We had another registration this afternoon so I assigned her to a team.  Current count as of Friday afternoon : 124.

          Wow...! this one seemed like a lot of work, looks great.  Did we say 124 was our cap and we go to a waitlist now?<br><br>I remember last year how much work Kevin put in on aligning (drafting, begging) coaches for this division as its alot of new parents.  It helped greatly this year I think, with the coaching needs.<br><br>Looks like the A's was tricky, nice work on that on.  (what is it with those A's)

          Now that this is finalized, my goal is to email the Freshwomen coaches tonight with information on how they can access their rosters and immediately follow up with an email to all Freshwomen players letting them know their team assignments.  <br><br>The feedback was positive when we did this last year vs. allowing the rumor mill to stir with some coaches/daughters knowing and others not.<br><br>I am sure we may get responses from coaches questioning rosters but we will need to manage it.  Each roster move was done for a reason.<br><br>Let me know if you are okay with sending this email out.  Thanks.

          You may have already sent out the freshman list, which is great.  It looks really good, nice work!  One thing about the timing or release of rosters to coaches, as last year, once it is out, some coaches touch base some dont right away, which does lead to kids asking have you heard or been contacted.  We may want to give the Freshman a guideline in your email, or it can wait till the meeting.
