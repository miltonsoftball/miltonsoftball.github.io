    <p>I didn't ask either of you for your opinion but I felt like I had to send something to the BOD basically asking them to keep the conversations last night among the BOD and to give the three of us some time to figure things out. I am not a good poker player and everyone could see through me and the fact that the three of us were not in unison.</p><p> </p><p>I already called CU Hall and booked Mon., 9/23 for the next general BOD meeting. They do not have this Wed. available for us to meet. Do we want to meet at the library or Darcy's or someplace else? Also what time can you meet, I can meet as early as 6:30pm.</p><p> </p><p>We are going to work this out together, see you both on Wednesday night.</p><p>Signed respectfully</p><p>Your softball wife</p>

          Needed a chuckle, and your signature did it....very clever.<br><br>I apologized last night to Kevin, and Karen I did not to you, so my apologizes as well, that was certainly not the outcome any of us want, or wanted. <br><br>My gut tells me its recoverable, and I know we can do the right thing.  Whatever is best for time and place, I am open.  I do have an late afternoon appointment down in Duxbury, but 6:30 should be okay.

          Library would work if available.  Otherwise, maybe Fish&amp;Chicken/Yogurt place is fine.  6:30 is great.
