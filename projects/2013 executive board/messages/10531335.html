    Received a call from a Mom yesterday, asking if it was to late to sign her daughter up.  I will respond to her on wecare email for its in the system.<br><br>Told her it is to late, along with teams being selected last month, uniforms have just been handed out.  But as I always believed, being a rec league, we will try to help even after registration.  She has a 3rd grader, and I told her we would check the Sophomore division rosters, as they are already maxed out, but we will check to make sure all the uniforms and girls that signed up to play are playing.<br><br>Did we order 14 shirts across the board on that division, or to the roster amount, which is what we have been doing.  I noticed two teams with 13, the rest with 14.  I am not looking to add a 14 to the roster with 13, just checking.<br><br>The women's name is Dawn Karol, daughter is Ava, a 3rd grader at Cunnigham.  I will email her.
