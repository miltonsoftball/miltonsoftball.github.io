    Don't read this until you have time it's very LONG...<br><br>I reviewed what Rich came up with as well as the Booster's and the Hock applications and guidelines. Gary I also looked at the list of things you sent me via email. I have a few questions/comments that I need to address before proposing the MGSA guidelines and application. I have a draft but want to see how you both feel about certain issues. Please let me know your thoughts on the following. I would prefer not to get a committee to come up with guidelines and application only because today is 3/28 and if we need a deadline or early May we need to get this out asap.<br><br><ul>
<li>Do we have a statement that says we are a non-profit? If so I think we should include that and I would love to see the exact language.</li>
<li>I think it's a good idea to include our mission statement as well on the application. My reason for doing this is that we are asking the girls to write an essay and I want to see if they write about some of the goals of the mission statement in their essay.</li>
<li>One of the qualifications that Rich listed is "The Milton Girls Softball Association will be
sponsoring two (2) annual $250 scholarships for graduating high school students
who have participated in the MGSA for a minimum of four years and are planning
to continue their education at a vocational school or college or university (two-year
or four-year) or have enlisted in a branch of the US Armed Forces." I don't agree with the Armed Forces part of this...what are we giving them money for? school after the miliarty? or beer/party money? I know that they are doing a great thing for our country and I also know that giving someone money doesn't mean that they are going to put it toward their tuition or books but I think there's a better chance of that if the person is not only applied to but accepted and going to a college/university.
</li>
<li>College you plan to attend, has the person applied and has the person been accepted--I think we should either ask for photocopy of the letter of acceptance or correspondence that they have committed to going to a school. How do we prove this? Hock asks the question but Booster's doesn't. I am not comfortable asking the question and then not getting proof.</li>
<li>What do you think of offering  it to a student that is accepted to a college, university, technical or vocational school--2 or 4 year? I think all of them are acceptable.<br>
</li>
<li>I don't think we should include personal references unless we intend to call them and I am not a firm believer in getting references. Why would someone put down a bad reference? The answer is they don't. Even terrible employees know people that will tell a white lie to as a favor.</li>
<li>Booster's asks for a parent's signature, should we require one or both?</li>
<li>Booster's asks for a letter of recommendation, should we require this? Boosters is very specific asking for that person to "please describe the nature of your association with this student, and please comment on how the student has demonstrated the qualities of the award, such as their success, determination, teamwork, leadership, sportsmanship, respect and commitment."</li>
</ul>Gary you had mentioned Margaret Gibbons from MHS that manages the Booster's scholarships, do you think it's a good idea for me to call and/or meet with her to ask these types of questions. Please let me know and I can follow up with her on Monday.<br><br>Please let me know your thoughts and then I will finalize the applications and guidelines and send them to you tomorrow.

          <b>Non-Profit-</b> our non profit statement is stated the exact way in our articles of Incorporation as our mission stmt- "<i>Milton Girls Softball is an independent, non-profit organization committed to providing all girls with an experience that fosters positive self-esteem, team spirit and individual growth through personal achievement and team play.<br></i><br><b>Mission Stmt-</b> Totally agree, we have always tried to point to it, abide by it, and foster it.  Kevin has done a nice job making sure it was in all the materials handed out this year.  It is our guiding force.<br><br><b>Qualifications for College- </b>My belief will cover the college/army question, along with the 2 or 4 year.  I think its important to be as inclusive as possible as a town recreational program.  I can agree with your thoughts on the Army point, and honestly have shared that view at times, but for what we want to be, and reasons to offer a scholarship, I think it should be a big picture view.  One that is encouraging to any individual graduating from high school to be making an attempt to better themselves in their next step from High School.  College, 2 or 4, vocational, does not matter, as long as they show they have a plan to continue their education (at a higher level than HS),, or improve themselves in the armed services, college may not be for everyone, they are going on to improve themselves in college or the armed services.<br><br><b>References-</b> I agree, I did not see that was part of the application, not necessary<br><br><b>Boosters info- </b>The signature has helped in a few ways.  Not all kids are 18 yet, but more importantly, these types of things are more about the process sometimes than ,the individual getting the award.  By having the parent sign, it brings a level of awareness and seriousness to all involved, the quality is improved (parents help to make sure its done well), the candidate learns more about being responsible.  One parent is fine, head of household if getting very detailed (to impersonal for me).<br><br>The letter of recommendations have helped in many cases, when its difficult to choose.  The problem with the letters, it can quickly put a more emotional element into it.  You see quickly, the differences, make judgement  possibly that should not be made, but its the human element part.  In the end, maybe make it an option, for those that take that step and do it, it helps the committee quickly narrow things down. If you do request or make it an option, as you mentioned above, its best to have the letter focus on what attributes or strengths to outline.<br><br>Margaret Gibbons is actually the head nurse at MHS, (not involved with the boosters), and runs the Awards Scholarship night, which I think is May 28th this year.  It is her job to line up all the awards, which organization is giving scholarships, invite the presenters  etc.  Her timeline is more geared to the awards the high school is involved in, the outside awards, she will let you know when to come, if she needs anything, helping with how to make sure the award recipient will be there, etc.  I will email you her info tomorrow or send you an intro.  Before you touch base with her, you will already now, all aspects of the application, how to get it, where to submit it, by when, and who will be going to present it.<br><br>The selection committee should be revolving each year,  keep one as the chair and knows the process from the year before, as the other 2 continue to rotate.  I would be happy to be on it this year if it makes sense.  You may want to consider having the applications submitted as anonymous to the committee at first, I can explain more if interested, but it allows you to be more neutral not knowing the name of the applicant.

          Karen -<br>Awesome job on the Scholarship guidelines and application.  I added my comments to the document using tracking changes so you can see them.<br><br>Some additional thoughts:<br>I would suggest that Karen is on the committee and she recruits two others to help out.  I think Jen T. and Nick would be great adds.  I think one E-board member is the max.  Maybe next year we can look at it differently.<br><br>I think we need to be clear that players of board members are eligible (Johnson, Fitz, etc.).  <br><br>I think that when you receive the applications, you hide/whiteout the names and instead add unique numbers to each application.  Provide a copy to each committee member for review.  This will keep it fairly and possibly anonymous (depending on the contents of the essay).<br><br>Think about how you are going to rank/rate each application against one another.  Is it based solely on the essay?  What key criteria are you looking for in the essay to be a top consideration?  These are questions the committee needs to establish prior to reviewing applications.<br><br>Can you also think about what we write in the email to candidates as well as how we publicize it to the league community/town community?  <br><br>I know Gary has to weigh in, but once he does feel free to keep it moving. Great work!

          I updated the application, Kevin I included all your comments and was specific in asking for the essay length to be 400 words minimum and 500 words maximum, double spaced. I typed up a mini pseudo essay and it was around 600 words. I don't think we want their life story just what they learned in softball that will help them later on in life.<br><br>I think 4 years in the recreational league should be the rule...what do you both think?<br><br>I love the idea of someone (other than the people on the committee) putting white out on the names and specific references that might tie it to a person and then the committee reviewing it.<br><br>One more rule that I think we should add/modify is the relation, I too think Jen would be great on the committee but she is related to Rich FitzGerald. I don't want that coming back and biting us that she was on the committee if Sydney were to be awarded. To keep things above board I think Rich, Jen and Kenny should have nothing to do with this (this year). I have no problem leading the group, who else should we ask? Someone mentioned Nick, what about Ted to get him involved. Or maybe Dana although he is busy with equipment.<br><br>Please review it and LMK your thoughts. I would love to have this finalized and available by this weekend. Reasonable timeframe?

          Looks great!  I think we are ready to launch it.<br><br>Three comments:<br><ul>
<li>Under "to be eligible ...", each bullet should be in the same tense.  </li>

          I made a few more changes per your comments. I think this is the final application. If you have time today please review it and let me know.<br><br>Few questions for tonight:<br><br><ol>
<li>Should I bring copies with me?</li>
<li>Should I ask the BOD for input?</li>
<li>Should we ask people before the meeting if they would like to be on the committee or ask at the meeting? (IMHO I would like to see either Shawn or Ted or Nick be one of the members to get them involved. I also don't think that Rick or Jen or Kenny should be on the committee this year. Is there anyone else that would have a conflict of interest?).</li>
<li>I don't think we should accept email applications. I think I want to see the original signatures, what do you both think?</li>
<li>How should we publicize this? I think we should:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>Post it online in .pdf formats</li>
<li>Email everyone that is in the league today.</li>
<li>If we have emails from years ago we should email everyone that would be eligible.</li>
<li>I can contact local high schools and give them the information as well. I will work on a list of local high schools today.</li>
</ul><br>I think that's it, let me know your thoughts.

          The scholarship guideline looks great (I assume you caught the spelling on Mission).  Maybe on Qualifications, we should have it mention the sponsoring of two (2) annual scholarships is our goal or objective.  There may be years we have more or none, based on the balance in our operating account.<br><br>I think it would be great to show the Board what you have.<br><br>Its kevins preference to see if he wants to ask or appoint.  My opinion is, its always good to be invited (may not get on, but invite doesn't hurt)<br><br>I agree on the no email applications.  Some things are good to see in writing.<br><br>I think your ideas to get it out there, are great.  Having it online is great to be able to get an app, along with HS.  There is a spot in the Times (Happenings?), not sure what it is called, does not cost anything, just notices, which would be good as well.<br><br>Great job, the finish product is something to be proud of, for you, the board and the league.

          Looks great.  Definitely hand it out to everyone.  I think you tell them we are launching Wed.  Any feedback should be to you by Tuesday night.<br><br>In terms of emailing, I was suggesting it in the sense that applicants would scan and emailed the applications with a signature.  No worries if it causes more confusion.<br><br>I would ask others if they would like to be part of it but maybe hit the names you listed above as well (even before the meeting if you can).<br><br><b>Do you want me to print copies for you while I am at work?  Let me know.</b>

          Kenny Johnson called me last night and again today about some clarification on what his daughter needs to submit for the application. He also asked if she could send in her volunteer hours. I told him no because it's not a requirement and that we would discuss that for next year but I cannot take it from her and take it into consideration when it's not a requirement for everyone. I told him that if it's applicable she should include it in the essay. I told him that we need to deal with this above board and have it fair for everyone. He asked me how we were going to review the applications and not know the specific information.<br><br>Kevin...I think you should just give the committee the essays and not the application because there is so much information that will identify the girl. We can do this 1 of 2 ways regarding the application. You can review the applications and only give me the essays that are valid applicants (hopefully all of them) or the committee can read the essays and vote on them. After we decide who the top 2 "winners" are then I could take the applications and make sure that all the information is accurate and that they followed and met all the requirements. Let me know what you both think.<br><br>I told Kenny that this is a learning process, it's the first year and after taking what Rich had proposed I reviewed 3 other organization's guidelines and applications (MH Boosters, Hockomock and Fallon Ambulance). I told him that  I am going to do the best I can to make sure that this is a fair process for not only his daughter but all the girls that apply. He also asked me who was on the committee and scowled about Laurie and told me she holds grudges. I repeated again that it will be a fair process.

          Karen, I am glad you updated us with this information.<br><br>Kenny has been a tremendous help to the program, but this is Kenny being Kenny.  I do believe its a bit stepping over the line,  as innocent as it may be, he should know the difference, with being on the board.  I do not think other board members would be making those type of inquires.  I do think he was looking to influence the situation possibly. (2 calls from a board member, on a subject that directly effects his daughter? along with asking who is on the committee and making comments).<br><br>fyi... i received the same type of inquiry from him for the Boosters scholarship.  Once I let him know its a blind process, he backed down.<br><br>In reference to the process, I think the essay along with the application can make it easy to possibly identify someone (just how it is).  The tenant behind the process of blind evaluation  (besides execution), is for transparent-ency, and, fairness be allowed to be used in the attempt of selecting candidates (in theory).  In practice, it is easy for the committee to assume and guess who it is, (its a small pool of candidates, and a small community), but they actually do not know.<br><br>A suggestion would be for all applications go to Kevin.  Only he opens them. (Karen you will see the originals as well, but not till after some of the first steps). He would make copies of the apps and essay, and white out the name of the individual or significant info that would divulge the individual.  Code them with a number, and give them to Karen (committee Chair).<br><br>As Chair you would help guide the committee (there will be alot of subjective interpretation and input) to stay on track to rate the apps on a scale (your choice, in line with the reqs and info).  Sometimes the essay is used to help in a tie, or in the overall score. <br> <br>The Chair would take the input from the committee, have the top 2 winners, and submit them to Kevin.  He can confirm, or if there is further clarification, he can decide or in the case of the hock and the boosters boards I had experience with, the EB was used.<br><br>Either way, I would suggest, after the apps are in, committee has weighed in, and Karen is finished to present or has chosen, with this being our first year, we should have the EB stay either involved or enrolled to advise, for the EB can help formulate the best practices going forward, as this will continue to evolve as a process.<br><br>Lastly, to help what may be a difficult year to select only "2".  In the past, with other programs, we had the leeway to grant 1 or 2 more scholarships, based on the original scholarship budget guidelines.  With not going into much detail here, (which we should confirm at some point, our formula), I would suggest using a number like 15% (up to) of the operating funds balance.  The General funds balance is our main balance and we should choose to have a operating (funds) balance be funded each year end out of the General fund balance.   Out of the operating funds, the 15% should come out of that to fund the scholarships each year. <br><br>Example- General funds was about 21-22k before restricted funds, or surplus initiatives or allocating to operating fund balance.   Take 20% of the general funds, = $4,400, is what is left in our operating funds at the end of a cld yr.  Out of the $4, 400 (operating fund balance), that is what the scholarship is tied to each year.  As our general funds increase or decrease, the scholarship amount is on a sliding scale up to a max, but  we should not say a minimum, (in case in future years, the amt left in the operating balance is to small).  This allow the scholarship fund to be funded while the program can maintain all general operating requirements first, to the league.  <br><br>Short version, take a look now to see if we think there is $750 or $1,000 (4 scholarships)to possible award.  The backwards math would be, if we had about $6700 allocated in the operating fund balance at the end of a year, we could allocate up to $1000 in scholarships. (15% of $6,700),, which would mean, we would need a General fund balance of about $33,500. (20% of 33500= $6700)<br><br>The numbers of course can be changed to meet the goals and objectives.

          I have been thinking about what the next step is for the Scholarship "program" and I am going to create a process document with detailed steps that the committee will follow. I know we have a lot going on this week with the parade so my goal will be to get the document organized and get it my first draft to you early next week. Can you both please review it and give me feedback next week? After you both review it and we have a revision of it I would like Ted and Laurie to review it as well and get buy in from them that we have a defined process and steps that we will follow. I don't know how I feel about giving the document to the BOD to review. Think about it.<br><br>My goal is to make sure that the process is transparent so that nothing comes back to the BOD about misconduct/favoritism when the awards are announced.<br><br>Please let me know your thoughts.

          Karen- fantastic job on the outline and process, not to mention all the other work, it looks great.  The qualify/disqualify you have seems like it would work fine.  An option to use instead of disqualify (because you may not have many applicants), is to assign a point value beside each category.  1 point (or some number) if its doubled spaced for example, no point if not.  You could also look to use values or points to assign for each metric you are looking for (i.e. mgsa mission =1 pt).<br><br>The essay you may want to weight or value, based on a number of points covered, possibly the amount of involvement in volunteering, community service, etc. (Next year we may want to put on the application, a check box beside all the opportunities they could have been involved in, parade, clinics, all star, umpiring, summer tryouts, etc.)<br><br>This type of awards are always fluid, and change each year.  For our first one, this is as close to perfect as you can get, nicely done.

          I incorporated comments from both of you.<br><br>I talked to Mitch (the numbers guy) and I changed the voting system by assigning one point if they did what we ask of them for 4 different categories. Then the committee would pick their top 3 candidates and assign 5 points for 1st place, 3 points for 2nd place, and 1 point for 3rd place. We would tally all the votes and then the top two candidates with the most points wins the scholarships. If there is a tie I will bring it to the both of you to review.<br><br>Please review the document and let me know if you have any more comments and if not I want to get this to Ted and Laurie this weekend for them to review.<br><br>Gary...can you please get Kevin a key to the PO Box so he can pick up the applications Monday?

          Karen- The process doc looks great, I think the quantitative addition will help.<br><br>Kevin- I dropped off the key and the bank papers, they are in your mailbox.  The bank papers are pretty straightforward, and I marked where you need to fill out and sign.  You have to go to the branch to show your ID and get added to the account.  Bill signed his sheet and will just be dropped off, since he is already on the existing account.    <br><br>I had Karen as secretary sign the back of the bank doc that is for the bank, as the bank asked, and they asked me to sign to verify the TIN #.  Once checks show up for the new account, Bill will sweep the remaining funds from the old to the new, and write current checks from the old until then.  We swept about half of the balance into the new account to set things up.  <br><br>The bank suggested to do the transfer the way it was done.  After your paperwork and Bill paperwork is in, sometime next week or whenever, you or Bill can remove me of the new account.  I am on there from the transfer of the old to the new, and the verification of the TIN #, and can be removed at anytime.  <br><br>I did not want to setup online for the new account, that should be done by Bill and for you.  I did clarify the old account old online access, and gave that to Bill tonight, along with balance info etc.  <br><br>This existing (old and original account) we are closing, has some history we should document, such as, it was the original bank account for the girls program in Milton (96 maybe).  The tax number is important and the history of it, etc.  I will maybe make some notes and we can put it into a doc file someplace.<br><br>From an organization or club standpoint, our articles have two people listed on our treasury funds, Pres and Treasurer.   The check and balance has been between those two, and the responsibility of each to check the accounts and statements.  Of course, with Ray being great at it, I never checked the stmts much, except at beginning and ending of season and year end.  The process works well, even with trust in place, both parties can check quickly on any funds debited from the account, looking at any checks , withdrawals,  or credit card expenses, and quickly account for every penny.<br><br>In my opinion, as I have already mentioned to Bill as the treasurer, the more details that can be recorded for expenses on the minor, little debits, checks, etc, are most important.  As time goes by and you look back at expenses, its the smaller ones that you want to have every penny accounted for, the bigger ones are always easy.

          Thanks for your efforts to get this going.<br><br>I signed the papers and brought them to Citizens.  Arleen was not working (I think that's who the bank told me had been working on it).  After meeting with someone else, I was told that you may need to come down.  The woman told me that you need to authorize my name being added to the account and that you also need to complete a form to remove Ray from the account.  <br><br>The woman I met with also only pulled up one account (checking and money market).  She didn't see another account.  I didn't want to belabor the point since she said that nothing could be finalized until you and Arleen connected.<br><br>Let me know if there is anything else you need from me.

          Sorry, that was what we were hoping to avoid, and they suggested the paperwork that way.  My fault for not mentioning the Manager John was the final contact, as I was getting a bit of a run around a couple of weeks ago.  With the account being so old, it did seem to create some confusion within their decisions.<br><br>The paperwork you submitted should do what we need done,  I will check with John on Monday.  I know Ray is not on the new account, and it is Bill and you on the new account, and they had to list me as VP on new (then remove), to transfer old one (this was the process I questioned),but they suggested it was the easiest way, for each individual on new acct (Kevin and Bill) can come down on their own, at their discretion.<br><br>My expectations would be, on Monday, John has your paperwork, and Bill's, and I can confirm the new account is official with you two on it.  Confirm checks are being sent out, and then close the old account once they arrive.  As new officials on the account, you and Bill will be receiving new debit cards as well.  I have online access to old account I can give you (offline) anytime.  I am going to suggest to Bill to get a copy of electronic stmts, dating back as far back as they will give him without any cost, for we can storage file them.  I don't like closing an old account without a good copy of records, just in case we ever need to go dig something up.

<li>MHS--ceremony is Tuesday, 5/28 at 7pm. Someone will need to arrive 15 mins before ceremony. Award and check will need to be dropped off ahead of time to Margaret Gibbons.
