    I spoke with Chuck last week and we confirmed the order today, uniforms are ordered and should be in around 2 weeks. I will need the sponsors by Wed., 4/3 to give to Chuck (should I reach out to Kenny and Shawn or do either of you need to be involved? LMK). My goal is to have the shirts done and in my hands the week before April vacation.

          I must have posted an update on another thread that I can't find right now. Wanted to give you both an update. I went to SF today and picked up:<br><br><ul>
<li>Fit kits for helmets...Kevin LMK if you want me to drop them at your house or hold onto them.</li>
<li>Senior Rockies shirts for Laurie...I can call Laurie and drop them off to her later today if you want, not a problem at all.</li>
<li>Fresh Cubs shirt #6... I don't know who this goes to. I can drop it to Kevin's house or I can deliver that this afternoon too. LMK your preference.</li>
</ul><br>We are 100% done with SF except Chuck mentioned something about catcher's equipment. Kevin LMK if you need me to drop something off or pick something up from SF. I am around all week so it's not a problem to get back over there.
