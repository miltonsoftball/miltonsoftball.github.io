          <div>I just heard back from Dirt Dawg to confirm the Sunday clinics for the Jr division.  His time slot available is 12:30- 2, so we will go with that, and he did not have the 17th available to start, so we will start on March 24th, then April 7,14, &amp;21.  This is a tweak from last night, I missed Easter was the 31st.  Also vacation, but I guess we could either do a make up or move it.</div><div><br></div><div>TJO, I am waiting for confirmation on Monday's for the Senior Division, starting March 18, 25th, April 1,&amp; 8th. 6:30-8pm.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin, are you available at all for the Jr or Sr clinics, no biggie if not, just wondering from a planning stand point.  I also think putting your name as one of the Milton Coaches/ instructing or involved would draw kids.</div><div><br></div><div>Coaches Clinic I could do April 14th, but that is vacation. We could do a week night, maybe the 11th (Thur), or that first Monday night of the start of the season that we were going to block out for practice/makeups , the 22nd, which might be okay.  I need to see if that is available.  Coaches clinic would be 2 one hour slots, Freshman/Sophomore,  then the Jr/Sr coaches (covering practice plans, teaching fundamentals, systems and philosophies)</div><div><br></div><div>April 27th Dirt Dawg is available for Summer tryouts if we go that route, and they will help or conduct evaluations.  The April 28th is the targeted date for the Open House Pitching clinic, which he would give us space (no charge).  The only small nominal fee he said he may want a small amount for the coaches clinic slots.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin, Brian Mantiville told me he touched base with you today, I already had let him know he is good for the Soph Cubs with Martin, and Freshman we put Paul Walsh with him, just confirming.</div>

          I think 4/14 and 4/21 are not great dates because of school vacation (and especially 4/14 with the long weekend).<br><br>See what you have from your Clinic committee in terms of attendance and maybe I can fill in for people or fill in any gaps that may exist.<br><br>Let me know when you have the dates confirmed.  Also, when you have it send over the language/description you want to use for the email, website and registration. I can work to get the registration set up once I have it.
