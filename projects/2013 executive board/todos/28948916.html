        <div class="content">
          I provided the following feedback to the designer:<br><br>------<br><p>Hi Marianna,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thank you for all your work on the website.  I have had time to look at the design and collect my thoughts:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I like what you did but I think the green is dominating the design.  You have done incredible work with the logo and I think with it sitting on a green background we lose some of the pop with it.  I like the thought of the logo sitting on a white background - or maybe even blue sky.... something subtle that doesn't dominate the page.  I think what is happening with this design right now is that the background is dominating the page when it should be an accent.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Also, let's keep the logo together (milton girls softball).  The milton, massachusetts can be supporting text someplace else on the page.  I could even include it in the content if necessary.   I love the use of the softball on the left and the type treatment on the right.  The use of the girls also gives it some personality.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am happy to discuss in greater detail if you would like more clarification.  I know sometimes things can get lost on email.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thanks for all your help.</p>
<p><br></p>

          Looks great!  Is it similiar to yesterday on how you pointed out to me, it looks really cool in the plain format, and different with the home page overlay on it?

          Check out miltonsoftball.com if you can.  I don't want to leave this up but figured you could see it live.    Here is a screen shot.

          Sorry I don't love it. I think that the M in the lower left is distracting and it looks like gravel. What about tan so it looks like the dirt on the infield?

          I agree with you regarding the gravel.  My fear with the tan is that it will dominate the page.  <br><br>I still think it will pop with white.  I will try to find some examples to send her.  Any other feedback you have would be great.

          <br>I sent the designer the feedback we had. I think I will give her 1-2 more revisions.  If it doesn't work, I may have to with Plan B (me!).  <br><br>I also had an idea.  How about if we removed the sponsorship ads from the top and I placed them in the right hand column (maybe under the countdown clock but above the weather).  The ads will still be "above the fold" (meaning you do not have to scroll to see them).  it could also open up the design at the top.  What do you think?<br><br>Sorry for all the emails/posts.

          Blue is better, but not sold completely, and the softball, should be above the fold?

          Some other options.  If you happen to be online now, go to the home page.  I added one of the options temporarily to see it in context.
