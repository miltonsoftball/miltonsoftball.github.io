          Ray passed on an organization that asked if we could give us some field time for them.  It's the MNLL Challenger Division and they are looking for a field for six weeks between late April and early June and merely require 90 minutes per week. They said that Saturdays (anytime) would be optimum - but Ray mentioned to them that 1 pm Sundays as being better on our end.<br><br>I'd like to help them. Gile would make the most sense - prob on Sunday early afternoon.<br><br>Do you have the permits for the fields?  Can you provide any details on exclusion dates, times, etc?

          The schedules are set so it may be a good idea to confirm with Perdios and Dave W. for Cunningham that are permits and schedules are accurate.<br><br>Notes:<br><ul>
<li>In addition to our M-F 6-8; Sun 3-8, we also need Cunningham all day on 4/20 and also every following Saturday from 11-1 until early June</li>
<li>We have Gile on Sat all day 9-8.  Just confirming that this will not conflict with MHS varsity?</li>
<li>We are loaning Gile on Sundays from 12-3 to MNLL (special needs Little League) - you will see it on the schedule</li>
<li>You mentioned that National Little League may be asking for the field?  I would hold off if possible for practice, makeups, etc.</li>
<li>We need Gile lights on 6/1 and 6/15 </li>

          Gary -<br>Wanted to check in on the field schedules:<br><br><ul>
<li>Any update on the field usage for Sunday morning?  Has any formal requests come in?  If it's unavailable we should block it off on the master calendar</li>
<li>Are we confirmed for night games on 6/1 and 6/15?</li>
<li>Do we need/have a permit for Cunningham?  We have a bunch of Saturdays at 11 and Sundays at 3 and 5.</li>
</ul>Let me know if you need help getting schedules to Cunningham and Perdios.  Thanks.

          I have been waiting to hear back from NLL.  I told Dave yesterday I need to confirm or move on.  The HS I will be blocking 8-10 am on Sunday at Gile, but if NLL does not need 10-12, we may move that.  I just looked at calendar this morning, and was going to block off, as the HS has inquired about mornings next week during vacation.  I hope to be able to do it all at once.<br><br>We are confirmed on our night games.<br><br>Have been in touch with Dave at CP, and permit is probably in the mail.  I have been speaking with him about the infield clay and asking if there is something that can be done to turn it over, loosen it.  It has not been maintained over the last 3 + yrs.
