          I was not clear on who you want to follow up on any coach questions, inquiries.  I would be happy to touch base with previous coaches to gauge interest or returning status and reach out to new potential coaches, just let me know.<br><br>I think Greg Lange should be more of a question mark, or potential ask, no info on him.  Brian Conroy asst was Andy D'Amato.  We should list Ted Carroll as a potential for Senior division.<br><br>Let me know if the best way is to update the current word doc, with adjustments or info, or feed it to Karen, whatever is best.  i.e,- lets add to each division listed, projected number of Coaches (teams) needed.  At the sophomore division, we need 7 and if we have trouble getting one more, Pelton and Mullaney I think were the two new recent that submitted interest form.<br><br>On the Freshman level, there are a number of Coaches that need confirmation of returning. (McNeely was not sure, Noreen Middleton, Johnson Woodward come to mind). To Karens note on Ayles and Curley as well, same.

          I believe the next steps where as follows:<br><br><b>Kevin</b> to confirm all coaches at the Fresh/Soph/Junior level.<br><b>Gary</b> to check with Arleen, Meg and Greg Lang regarding interest in coaching at the Senior level. Feel free to reach out to Ted Carroll on Seniors if you think he'd be interested.<br><br>I have taken the Word doc and put it into Excel.  Emails went out to almost all the Fresh/Soph/Junior coaches Monday morning.<br><br><b>Freshmen</b> - waiting to hear back from 3<br><b>Sophomore</b> - 7 confirmed (so this is complete)<br><b>Junior</b> - may be tricky because if Eric Kelly comes back we have 4 returning and 3 moving up for a total of 6 spots.<br><br>We had Middleton as a Freshmen coach but she confirmed she wants to coach at Sophomore (her daughter moved up).<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions.

          <b><u>Junior Division</u></b><br>Eric Kelly has confirmed he is returning.  So we have the following returning coaches:<br><ol>
<li>Eric Kelly - returning</li>
<li>Michael
  Kinsella—returning</li>
<li>Dan Rose/Ted Carroll—returning</li>
<li>Rich Shea/Hugh Kelly—returning
 </li>
</ol><br>The following are moving up and would like a team:<br><ul>
<li>Mike Papile/Mark Garuffi/Brian
  Possi—moving up</li>
<li>
 Bill Vaughn/Bob McCarthy/Rulon—moving up</li>
<li>
 Dana Rundlett—moving up </li>
<li> Eric Kelly</li>
</ul>We have planned for 6 teams x 13 players a team = 78 players.  We currently have 75 players.  It's unlikely we can support 7 teams at 13 player = 91 players.  I think 12 per team is too little at this level (and I am not sure we would have 84 girls).  Who has seniority from the three above?  Could anyone team up with Mike or Eric?<br><br>Thoughts?

          If Dana is the only one man show could he coach with Eric or Michael?

          Attached is my first pass at the Sophomore Tesam Assignments.  Can one or both of you take a look? You will see team assignments at the top and then the full downloaded registration below the teams lists.  I also have a FULL copy of the Sophomore registration on another tab in the doc for reference.  <br><br>Things to review:<br>1. Are the coaches coaching their own kids?  Silly, I know.  But should be reviewed.<br>2. Do we follow all the requests (you can see the requests in the excel doc)<br>3. Do we have balance of 3rd and 4th between teams.<br><br>4th are in green.  3rd are in purple.<br><br>Thanks for reviewing!

          <b>Gary</b> - You were gracious enough to ask how you could help with the team assignments which is great but I am wondering if you could help solicit more coaches for the Freshmen.<br><br>Currently, I have not heard back from Jay Rooney and Laura Harrington.  So we could start with them.  Also, we had Bob Neret listed as a Freshmen coach but I confirmed that he has two daughters at the Sophomore level so he is out. <br><br>I have heard from the following that they cannot commit to be a Freshmen Coach:<br><ul>
<li>











 
 
  Laura Woodward - Not coaching but has equipment.  Need to get it</li>
<li>
Rich Ricciard (daughter in 3rd, coaching
  baseball)</li>
<li>Scott Johnstone cannot do it</li>
<li>
Noreen Middleton (moving to Soph)</li>
</ul><br>We have 7 coaches and we need 3 (maybe 4 if we continue to add registrations).  Let me know if you can take this one.

          I reviewed the list of the teams vs the list of players and I found a few discrepancies:<ul>
<li>Gabrielle Bergan--should be grade 3</li>
<li>Grace Muir--why does it say grade 5?</li>
<li>Ella Neret--should be grade 3 (looks like sister is grade 4)</li>
<li>Haley Boylan--not on the list and her grade is 2 so I am assuming that she asked to be moved up a level</li>
<li>Ava Hanley--should be grade 3</li>
</ul><br>I did not cross reference the requests, would you like me to review that as well, LMK.

          Awesome.  I can make those updates.  <br><br>If you have time, it would be great to look at the requests.  Don't go crazy typing up notes, it may be easier to just call me and we can walk through anything you see (and then I may be able to explain my logic).  Some of them get complicated.<br>Feel free to call 857.300.2056 if it's this afternoon or my cell anytime.

          In order of what I missed, starting with Kevins list of contacting coaches.  My apologies, I only had Meg on my list to contact, and thought the Senior coaches was under Karen, I will leave Arleen and Greg to be contacted by Karen or you.  Meg did get back to me and she will coach a senior team.  Spoke to Ted and he will do a senior team if he can get help with who his assistant can be.<br><br>A couple of things we need to address for senior level if it wasnt yet, is the assigning of the draft selection order, and the assigning of kids and assistant coaches.  It is never perfect, but the assistant coach has been a big part of getting parents involved to coach.<br><br>On the Junior division coaching issue with Eric returning, the easy fix would be to put Dana and Eric together, they both fly solo, the other coaches have done a very commendable  job in reaching out to dad/mom's to help assist.<br><br>I just printed out the first pass of assignments and would like to review, and will also look at the requests.  Agree kids should coach own kid and will review the rest with comments in mind, at that age level, I believe we facilitate every request possible.<br><br>Will be happy to help with the Freshman coaches and fill the remaining slots.  I will send a email tonight to Jay Rooney and Laura Harrington saying I am following up for you.<br><br>Will send you the info shortly for the clinics.  We will stay away from vacation for any clinics as mentioned.

          <br>Just checked all Sophomore request up to R's, great job.   Not sure if I got it right, need to double check, Brennick is on Mariners, asked for Middelton, Middleton is on  Nationals (coach?).  Laura Cox ask for Lynch, Cox is on Dodgers.  Seems to be a triangle of Middleton, Gatnik, Brennick, not sure.

          I started reviewing the requests and then had to log out to deal with the kids. I will start over tomorrow and review it again and let you know how it looks.

          The Sophomore assignments have been updated.  Gary found a handle of errors and I think I corrected them.  <b>Karen</b> - please use this one for your reference. <br><br>Thanks.

          Sophomores looks great, you made quick work of that, awesome job!  As a note, I want to remember to let Sean Ward reach out to Molly Wells mom to help assist.  She wants to stay involved, once she knows her schedule.

          I was thinking yes, but probably better for Sean (as head coach) to bring her in to the fold when they start up, she is easy and quick to be a part of it.  Maybe just point it out to Sean at some point she will be a great one to bring in to help.
