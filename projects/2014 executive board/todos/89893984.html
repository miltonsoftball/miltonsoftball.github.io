          The rules have been updated.  Bill - can you review them? If they are okay I will print them out and include them in the packets for the Coaches Meetings.<br><br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.miltonsoftball.com/Page.asp?n=22106&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com" target="_blank">http://www.miltonsoftball.com/Page.asp?n=22106&amp;org=miltonsoftball.com</a><br><br>Thanks.

          For freshman, I would change the wording on practice time being 35-45 minutes and stress that full 45 be used and is an important aspect of program. Otherwise 35 becomes 25, ect and we end up with situations like last year where some are hardly practicing.

          Time change for all divisions  still says 5:45 not 6pm. For sophomore Would stress 5 walk rule as it was inconsistent last year. Junior division looks good.

          Rules for senior look good. Only confusion that I didn't think about is that if girl not leading at all, it's almost Sure steal attempt. This will be interesting to watch and probably a point of  emphasis to note to coaches.
