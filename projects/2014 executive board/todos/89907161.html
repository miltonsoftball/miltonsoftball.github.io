          Calese indicated she might I think , Karen did you get that vibe? . My suggestion was since this is larger number of teams and girls that we have an assistant coordinator as well. In addition to more volume, I asked Calese how many other coaches she knew and I think she said 3. If there is another clique of fresh coaches, it might be a good way to draw them in. Plus it's another set of eyes to watch and promote practice times, ect. Thoughts?

          I think two is a good idea. We need to determine what the responsibilities are since they will not be reporting scores and innings pitched like the upper divisions do.

          Definitely sounded like Calece might be interested but just want to make sure she's not signing up for too much. She did say that someone else didn't have the time to be on the board, maybe Calece and that person could do it together?<br><br>I think they need to make sure that practices and games are happening and rules are being followed.
