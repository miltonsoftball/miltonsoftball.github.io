          We will keep an eye out for assistants for some of the these coaches as we assign rosters.

          If you want a hand assigning teams, I'd be happy to assist. When do we think we'll have all the teams assigned? I'd like to start booking time slots at least for 9 freshmen teams at Dirt Dawgs, even if the teams themselves haven't been picked yet.

          Okay, so the Sophomore list is in decent shape and is ready for review.  I did have to shift coaches from one team to another (i.e. Nick is now coaching the Nationals).  This was to accommodate the requests we had for the coach or the coach's daughter and it could not be done when some teams had a lot of returning players.  <br><br>Coaches that moved teams were new coaches.  Returning coaches were not affected.<br><br>The assignment tab is the tab to review.  The other tab is a download from the website that has not been altered and can be a quick point of reference.  I have some color coding that should help (see the color code key on the right under the team lists.  <br><br>Things to check for when reviewing the document:<br><ul>
<li>Coaches have their daughter on the team (don't laugh, I have missed that before)</li>
<li>Returning players on the correct team (need to look at rosters from 2013 to compare (I have bolded returning players where I could)</li>
<li>All players have been assigned (Neret is an open item right now)</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from the registrations</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from wecare (check folder in email)</li>
</ul><br>Feel free to post comments here or edit the excel.  Either works.<br><br>Thanks for your help with this!<br><br>Kevin<br>

          At first glance, I'd say the Blue Jays need more coaches...

          It's not them.  It's me.  I haven't committed to any of them (although Gary may have recruited Wells).  I just didn't want to turn away parents who volunteered.  Happy to reduce it if you think we need to.

          Looked over rosters from last year. Didn't see anything but not much to compare as rosters are really turned over.

          Great. Did you get a chance to compare the teammate requests below the rosters with the actual assignments to make sure I didn't miss anything?

          Checked the sophomores against emails and bottom list on sheet. Only thing I saw was Ciera Fitzgerald Rays asked to play with Isabella Doten, who I don't see registered

          The rosters has been assigned on the website.<br><br>I went back to look at the pitching balance between teams. Unfortunately the IP data is scarce - something we need to emphasize with the coaches and the coordinator. <br><br>The updated (final) excel doc is attached.  I know it's a pain but if anyone can compare the excel to the rosters on the website, it would be a good QA check.<br><br>Thanks!

          Just reviewed:<br><ul>
<li>Nationals--on your spreadsheet missing Asst Coach.</li>
<li>Blue Jays--looks good.</li>
<li>Padres--you have Kaitlyn Paiva listed 2x.</li>
<li>Tigers--looks good but there are only two (2) 4th graders.</li>
<li>Mariners--looks good but there are only three (3) 4th graders.</li>
<li>Rays--looks good.</li>
<li>Dodgers--missing several Asst Coaches.</li>

          <p>Just proofed the website with the PROPOSED Soph list. and everything is all set on the website.</p><ul><li>Padres--Kaitlyn Paiva is on there twice so the website with 12 players is accurate, the spreadsheet with 13 players is incorrect.</li></ul>

          Thanks.  No need to worry about Paiva.  I left her on there twice but next to one of the name I indicated it was a dup.  My concern were the items in red. <br><br>Thanks for reviewing. Looks like we are all set with Sophomores.
