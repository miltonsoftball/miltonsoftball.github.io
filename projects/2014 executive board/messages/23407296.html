    <div>HI Maureen,</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for the kind words.</div><div><br></div><div>I think it may be helpful to share with you the process we as a league go through during the registration season. The process starts when registration opens and continues right up until the coaches meetings when the rosters are locked down and made public. We want to make softball a fun, enjoyable and learning experience for the girls.  At the end of the season we measure success by girls wanting to come back and play the following spring.  We are glad that Caroline had a good experience last season.</div><div><br></div><div>During the registration process, we request several keys pieces of information:</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Your daughter’s team from 2013</b></div><div>We ask this information because if your daughter played on a Sophomore Division Team in 2013, we will do our best to make sure she returns to that same team. The league wants to ensure that we have competitive balance across all teams so we do our best to make sure each team has an equal amount of 3rd and 4th graders. In your daughter’s case she was moving up from the Freshwomen division to a new team in the Sophomore Division.</div><div><br></div><div>You entered the Freshwomen Athletics since that is the team Caroline played on in the Spring of 2013.</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Selecting a Teammate</b></div><div>We understand that your daughter would like to play on the same team as a friend, classmate or neighbor.  We allow you to provide us with name of one player who your daughter would like to be paired with for the 2014 season.  For the pairing to be honored, we state that your daughter's friend must request your daughter during the registration process.  We can only honor one name and if multiple names are entered, we state that we cannot honor the request (even though we make an effort to).  We do our best to honor each request.</div><div><br></div><div>You entered Faith Rhodes.</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Interested in Coaching</b></div><div>We ask if you would be interested in coaching this season.</div><div><br></div><div>You left this blank.</div><div><br></div><div>When registration closes (this year it was March 1st), the three executive members of the Softball Board dig into the registration data.  We load everything into Excel.  We identify how many teams the Sophomore Division can support based on the number of girls registered.  We then look at the registration data to see who would like to return as a coach or coach for the first time. As a follow up we send a short survey to all the coaches from 2013 to reaffirm their decision to coach or not coach in 2014.  </div><div><br></div><div>Once we have the coaches’ set, we go through the following steps:</div><div>• Coaches’ daughters are placed on the team of the coach.</div><div>• Returning players (4th graders) are returned to their team from last year unless they have requested otherwise.</div><div>• We focus on the registration list and begin to pair up girls who asked to play together.  We pull together all the registration information from all the girls who registered for the Sophomore Division.  This year it was over 90 girls in the Sophomore Division alone.  We also have to do this for the other three divisions for a total of almost 400 girls.  We also review all emails that may have been sent to the league’s email address.</div><div><br></div><div>In the case of your daughter, she requested Faith Rhodes and Faith Rhodes requested your daughter.  This cross request created a pair that would be on the same team.  Since both girls were new, incoming players to the Sophomore Division, they would not be returning to a team from the previous season.</div><div><br></div><div>We continue to work through the process of matching players to one another (or matching them to a coach if one was requested in lieu of a player). During this process we make sure we keep the roster sizes to a manageable number. 12 or 13 are ideal but 14 is an ABSOLUTE maximum we allow per team.</div><div><br></div><div>After almost three weeks of long hours and multiple versions of Excel documents, the rosters are checked again and reviewed with fresh eyes.  We make sure we have covered every request as indicated from the registration data as best as we could.</div><div><br></div><div>Your daughter’s request to be paired with Faith Rhodes was honored.  Both girls indicated that they wanted to be teammates.  There was not any mention of being paired with a particular coach.  </div><div><br></div><div>We looked into the request you made last night after talking to Peter but Peter’s team is maxed out at 14.  With returning 4th graders and several tangled and complicated requests (for example: Player A requesting Player B and Player B requesting Player C and Player C being the daughter of a coach or an assistant coach), there is not much manipulation we can do without breaking some of these requests.  It’s not fair – especially to the girls who made a request during registration.</div><div><br></div><div>With the coaches meetings happening this week, the rosters are now public and coaches have begun to reach out to their players.  Rosters are essentially locked down. It’s very difficult to make changes once this happens.</div><div><br></div><div>In response to your question, we have fulfilled Caroline and Faith’s request to be teammates.  Unfortunately, we cannot fulfill the request of both girls being placed on Peter’s team.  Since your email last night, the Executive Board spent almost an hour looking at ways to make it work while still honoring the other requests.  If there were a way to make it work, we would try to fulfill the request. I am sure there is disappointment but I will tell you that both girls are together and on a team with another excellent coach.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you,</div><div>Kevin Olivieri</div><div>Milton Girls Softball</div>
