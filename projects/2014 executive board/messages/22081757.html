    Should we be getting together to figure out coaching placement, etc soon? Feb is winding down. I'm avail Monday night if you guys are as an option? I'm new to this so I'm not even sure of best sequence of planning.

          Yes, good idea.  I am waiting to see when Jessica's state tournament game is - either M, T or W - as soon as I know, I will suggest a day/time we can meet.

          I will take a first pass at the coaches looking at the coach survey we sent back in January and the information provided on registration.  <br><br>Our challenge will probably not be with lack of coaches, but with too many coaches. It looks like we will have reduced teams in each division.  <br><br>I'll work on the coaches over the next day or so.  Maybe we can plan on getting together this weekend?

          Sure. I have a couple updates from talking to people. Smokey is going to be an assistant for Brian Conroy. Larry Foley didn't put in to coach, but might consider if he had a strong assistant. I see from registration Mike Papile would also do it with a strong asst. (maybe a marriage there?) Eric Kelly's kid is moving up to senior and he didn't put in but might consider  we are short.

          Thanks. I included your notes in the attached.<br><br>This is what I did for future reference:<br><ol>
<li>Exported the data from the Google survey we sent out to coaches back in January</li>
<li>Looked at the coaches comments field registrations</li>
<li>Looked in the wecare@ email - 2014/Coaching Requests Folder</li>
<li>Reviewed last year's coaching list (from an excel we had) and went through each of the names to see if they were coming back, moving up or not coaching.  The<b> attached 2014 coaches excel doc</b> under the tab <b>2014 Coaches </b>shows who is confirmed to be coming back (designated in green).  </li>
</ol>You will see a few names that are listed but not in green.  He/she was a coach last year but have not indicated in any of our multiple channels that they would like to coach in 2014.  Manville, Kovac, Heelen, and Meg Toyias are a few of them.  Dana has not confirmed but I am guessing he is coming back.  Toyias is not coaching or playing.  <br><br>On the 2014 projected teams, I looked at the registration numbers by division and estimated how many teams we need for each division.   This is something we need to discuss.  I think Fresh is fine, but the others could use a discussion.  I think it's better to have more kids per team than less as long as it's not more than 13.  You will notice that if we do 13 per team for seniors we only have 4 teams.  Do we try to get by with 12?  12 girls per team X 5 teams is 60 girls.  We currently have 57 so 2 teams have 11 and 3 have 12.  <br><br>With kids involved in multiple activities and our Player Agent role currently unassigned and hiatus, this may be too much for us to handle.   Team reduction at the senior level will also mean that one team will be disbanded ... do the girls go back into the draft or reassigned by the league? We may want to manage the reassignments if it helps us balance pitchers and catchers.<br><br>The<b> coaches 2014.txt file </b>is a list of coaches that have said they could be a head or an assistant or help out but have NOT been assigned. We will need to assign them while also making sure we honor any request they had for their daughter.<br><br>Happy to chat over Basecamp, talk on the phone, or wait until the weekend.

          What's on the agenda for us meeting? Coaches and teams...anything else?<br><br>Personally I think the spring is the busiest time of year for families (worse than Christmas!). I think that between sports, dance recitals, first communions, graduations and then of course all the projects and field trips for school in May and June so my vote would be to have <b>less teams and more kids on the team </b>because of conflicts. What do you both think?<br><br>It's my turn to host so we can meet at my house, any chance your both available Friday night? After 6 is good for me and if you like sushi I can pick it up at MM for us or I can order pizza and/or salads. LMK

          So this is great all the meetings are scheduled and I was adding them to the family calendar and just realized that Aidan has an event on Thurs., 3/20 at CM. I can arrive late so I will be able to stay for the Soph meeting from 6-7pm but I won't be able to stay for the Junior meeting...is this okay with you Kevin? Sorry!

          No problem at all.  Family first.  <br><br>Don't feel like you need to go to the Soph meeting either.  Seems like a lot of rushing around.  If you are adamant about going to the meetings we could change the date as I have not sent anything out yet to the coaches.  I will probably do that soon as soon as I firm up the coaching slots.<br><br>Let me know what you think.
