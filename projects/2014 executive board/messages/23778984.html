    Kevin...I am going to create a list of every coach in the league. I told Shila at The View to give me the drink tickets and I'll keep track of the coaches and getting them one ticket each. Did you find the name tags? If not I can get some on Monday LMK.<br><br>Calece is bringing a check to pay for the event.<br><br>Kevin and Bill...I don't think we need anything else, can either of you think of anything?

          I had 65 people on our invite list and I counted 25 people that attended so that's 39%. Not sure what our numbers were last year but something to think about for next year when to host this event.

          I think being on a Monday with lousy weather didn't help. I think we'd have better turnout  on a wed or thursday next year when people more likely to want to go out.
