    I had made 2 cards for us to sign for Kenny and Jen and I totally forgot to have everyone sign them. I will bring them to the Feb. meeting, both are hoping to make that meeting. I will remind them the week before.<br><br>Llyod is going to be a rock star with the PR stuff. Have we asked him to be the chair for that area because he should be.
