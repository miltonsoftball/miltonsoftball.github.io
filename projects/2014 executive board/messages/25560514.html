    I am going to wait until Monday to escalate this but just as an fyi...Ted and Shawn were supposed to meet with me yesterday at 1:30pm on a conf call and I never heard from them. I emailed them both yesterday at 1:40pm and again last night @9pm and still nothing. I am going away this morning until Sunday so hopefully I'll have an update on Monday at the BOD meeting.
