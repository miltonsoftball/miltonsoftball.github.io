    Just a heads up...I will contact Chuck at SuperFlash on Thursday to check on the status of the uniforms. I don't know if I can get there on Friday so Bill I might have to take you up on your offer. If we get some of the uniforms I can contact the coaches and host a pick up at my house on Saturday for a few hours. If the uniforms are not ready until early next week I will definitely need help picking them up and distributing them because I am away Monday and Tuesday.<br><br>Talk later in the week when I have more information.

          Bill...I dropped off the Soph Blue Jays shirts for Chuck to change the lettering. The shirts should be ready today for pickup, Shawn has a game tomorrow at 1pm. Call Chuck to make sure before you make the trip over there this afternoon. Thank you!

          No problem. I already contacted Shawn and told him I would probably be dropping them off at his house tonight.
