    What should I do with everyone's requests for other equipment? Should I start a list and keep track or maybe I should start the list and give it to Dana to own updating? I didn't mean to create a free for all with everyone adding what they think we "should" have for a wish list but on the other hand if we want to spend more money on equipment the list will come in handy. I also don't want to step on Dana's toes with the equipment but he doesn't seem to want to lead this effort. I am going to email him separately and make sure that he is not put off from me organizing the helmets, catching equipment, balls and books. Thoughts?

          I would get Dana more involved as much as needed and off load what you can. I believe equip is his main committee, so he shouldn't mind being busy for a couple months. Other suggestion is to maybe forward emails and add another folder in we care for the equip requests just to have them available easily( though Dana wouldn't have it)

          Thanks for all your help with the equipment.<br><br>I think the additional ideas are nice but I personally feel that some of the equipment will go missing or get destroyed in the boxes.  I am not sure how to solve for it but maybe you pose the ideas out to the equipment committee on Basecamp and collect feedback.<br><br>I do think Dana needs to take some ownership.  I agree with your approach of emailing him.  Keep us posted as to his thoughts.  If he has lost interest, let's find a new committee for him to own.

          <p>I went to the wake last night and Dana wanted to talk Equipment! I told him next week when the services were over. I will email him and Rich and see if we either need to meet or at least figure out what else we need to do asap.</p><p>I think priorities are to figure out spring equipment bags and order asap if we need any and then get me the summer bags to silk screen. Last is to assign a pickup equipment day.</p><p><br></p><p>LMK if you can think of anything else.</p>

          Let me know when we settle on a date for Equipment Pickup Day.  I want to add it to the info for the coaches meetings Thursday.<br><br>We should also target a date for uniforms so we can share a rough timeframe to the coaches.

          I won't have a date for the equipment pick up until Wed., I am meeting with Dana and Rick. If we want to say tentatively Sat., 3/29 I think we'll have everything by then but I have a conflict that day so I just want to make sure that Dana and Rich can both do it that day.

          I had a chance to do a bulk print of the 26 page coaching manual so I tossed in 3/29 as the date with a "tentative" next to it.  I was able to print the manuals for Thursday's meeting.  I still need to do the copies for next week.<br><br>In terms of 3/29, I am happy to help out.<br><br>The goal is to make sure we have everything - helmets, bats, bags, ball, scorebooks, etc. so we are only doing this once.  If the date needs to move to achieve that, don't hesitate to do so.

          FYI, I will post more on the Equipment page later today:<br><br>Equipment pick up for coaches--keep Sat., 3/29 (I cannot be there but Rich and Dana can and I will post something to everyone if one or two more people could come help out that day. They were thinking 8-9:30am they will organize the bags includeing the new helmets, new catching gear, and new bats. There will be new game balls, gamebooks and clipboards as well. 9:30am to 12 noon the coaches can come and pick up the equipment.<br><br>This Sat., 3/22 SuperFlash is going to deliver all the helmets and catching equipment to the storage unit @ 7:15am. Dana and I will label and put stickers on all the new helmets and catching equipment as well as the clipboards. KEVIN...I NEED THE LABELS FROM YOU BEFORE SAT MORNING.<br><br><i>Dana and Rich asked that at the coaches meeting we stress that we have a lot of new equipment and we are investing a lot of money into the equipment and we want to make sure that the coaches keep track of it and we don't have new bats or anything else go missing at the end of the season. I am mentioning it here because I won't be there tonight.</i><br><br>Question, did we change the number of games every division is playing? I ordered too many balls. I looked at what our predictions were:<br><ul>
<li>Fresh. 6 home games and they are playing 6 home games</li>
<li>Soph. 7 home games and they are playing 6 home games</li>
<li>Jr 9 home games and they are playing 7 or 8 home games</li>
<li>Sr 7 home games and they are playing 6 home games</li>
</ul>Honestly it's not a big deal, I just ran the numbers and we will have 5 extra dozen balls, I just want to make sure we are all ok with the number of games we are playing in every division.<br><br>Everything else I will post under Equipment.

          Logo stickers for the helmets and ID stickers are all in storage.  They are in a box to left when you walk in (outermost corner).  I think it's a brown box.<br><br>Great idea on the coach's note.  We can mention it. I also included a one page handout last year stating the same thing.  It's attached for reference or if you want to use it when we hand out the equipment.<br><br><b>Game Balls</b><br>The games did not change from what we discussed but there may have been a miscommunication/misunderstanding.<br><br>Fresh - 9 teams -- 12 games = 6 home/ 6 away<br>Soph - 7 teams -- 12 games = play each team twice  - 6 home/ 6 away<br>Junior -6 teams -- 15 games = play each team 3 times  - 8/7 home and 8/7 away<br>Senior - 5 teams -- 12 games  = play each team 3 times  - 6 home/ 6 away<br><br>We also have a lot of new game balls in storage.  Not sure if you counted those against your order.  <br><br>We can always use the extras for playoffs and summer.  <br><br>Any update on the shelving?  Bats?<br><br>Finally, I am happy to help on 3/22 and/or 3/29.  Let me know.

          Kevin<br><br>Great idea...I will post the document above in the Equipment project and tell Dana to print 27 copies (1 per team) to give out on 3/29.<br><br>I did take into consideration all the balls in storage we currently have 60 softies and 50 11" balls. Like I said we will have 5 dozen extra of all different sizes.<br><br>Dana has not done the storage shelves. Can you please pose that question to Dana on the Equipment thread? I asked him last night and he acknowledged that he hadn't done it yet and that he does have to do it.<br><br>Rich has the first order of bats (he had to place 2 orders) already at his house and is expecting the 2nd order this week so he will have all of them by next week. He and Dana were discussing how to label them (? red electrical tape around the base if the bat). <br><br>As for volunteering, let's see if the BOD members will step up and help out for a few hours.

          Equipment is in great shape! I picked up everything (except catcher's equipment and helmets) at SuperFlash last night. Chuck was waiting for an order to be delivered today so as long as that happens Dana and Brian and I will meet Tony tomorrow morning 7:15am. (Plan B if equipment doesn't arrive today is to meet Tony at Storage next week one night). We plan to organize all the new equipment and label it so that all that is done for next week. Next Sat., 3/29 all that will need to be done is add the new bat, helmets to Jr and Sr, catching equipment to Fresh and Soph, new game balls, new clipboard and new book to each bag. Pass them out to the coaches along with the note.<br><br>How should I handle the fit kits and chin straps? Should I hold onto them until coaches request them or give them proactively to the coaches? Also, a question that you may or may not know, do new helmets come with a fit kit? LMK if you know the answers, if not I'll call Chuck today.

          Awesome!<br><br>The logs stickers for the helmets and the id labels for all the new equipment should be in the storage unit.  <br><br>New helmets do not come with a fitkit.  We ordered them separately.  BUT, there are about 15-20 fitkits in the storage unit.  I would give each team several.  We should explain to the coaches what they are and how they work.  If they need more, they can let us know.<br><br>I believe chin straps come with the new helmets so for Junior it's all set.  We can make sure each bag has some and it may be good to hang on to a few as requests come in.
