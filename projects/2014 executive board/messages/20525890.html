    I want to toss out an idea to the Executive Board.  I'd like you to give it some thought and maybe we can add it to our agenda.<br><br>Do you think that we should commit to each division playing on certain days at certain times?  For example, do we go public and state that Freshmen only play on Saturdays and Wednesdays.  Juniors only play on Saturdays from 9-2 and on Tue and Wed.  We wouldn't be able to control practice days but we <b><i>could</i></b> control game days.<br><br> I know a lot of parents are planners and love to schedule.  I know we won't please everyone (i.e. Maggie has violin on Tuesdays) but I think if we advertise and promote our schedules, it may get the lacrosse and soccer kids to commit if they know the parameters.  <br><br>Something we can chat about at our next meeting.

          I think the variability in our program is good. If a kid has lessons or plays another sport, they're more than likely so have that schedule set and can work ours around it. I think we stand to lose kids if we have a direct set time. Also, speaking personally, I like having different Saturday or Sunday start times as it allows us to do different things. Ex. Game in am, beach or whatever in afternoon or vice verse. Parents can plan everything by Mid April when schedule comes out.

          Part of me loves this idea but if you're child is playing abc on that day for games they miss all the games vs a variable schedule and the child might miss a game or two. I think a variable schedule is better for most of the girls (and parents).

          I am ready to drop games into the schedule but before I do if one or both of you have a few minutes can you look at the attached?  I create a master schedule.  It is empty of any games but it has our available field dates and times as well as any blackouts (mother's day, road race, men's league, etc.).<br><br>If we feel I am not missing anything, then I will start adding games to the excel.  <br><br>Thanks!

          Just reviewed the list and I have some questions:<br><ul>
<li>Mondays--are we going to have this a practice day with game makeups?</li>
<li>5/31--All Star Saturday, should we block off certain times for certain divisions?  </li>
<li>6/1--we don't have any slots for Andrews or Kelly, why?</li>
<li>Cunningham Field--confused when we can play games because sometimes there are only morning slots and other times later slots, why?</li>
</ul>I think the Milton Jr Club road race is the 2nd Tuesday in June so 6/10 would be accurate.

          Yes on Mondays.  Designated practice or makeup day.<br><br>Yes on ASG.  We will make sure a division does not have a game 3 hours before or after their ASG.<br><br>6/1 - completely an oversight.  Good catch!<br><br>We have CP M-F 6-8, Sat 9-1, Sun 3-8.  I did ask for CP all day on 4/26 (parade).<br><br>When do we want to do Summer Tryouts. We need to shift games around it.

          I think typically we have done a Saturday, but I think we do 5/18, Sunday morning from 9-1.  The week after is Memorial day and the two weeks out is the ASG.  It won't interfere with schedules since there aren't any games typically on Sunday.<br><br>We could do the following at Kelly:<br><ul>
<li>U14 9 -  10:30</li>
<li>U12 10:45 -  12:15</li>
<li>U10 12:30 - 2</li>
</ul><br>Do we have tryouts for U18?  Same day?  Different night?<br><br>What do you think?

          Do we know that Yaz league at CP starts April 27? Maybe They start in May and we can request that Sunday 9-3? I think CP from 3-8 might be worth a look as summer tryout times for some groups . Maybe u14 and U 12 as above in am, then 4-5:30 and 5:30-7 for u 10 and U18. That way we keep middle of day open for everybody who wants to plan other things?

          We can chat about it.  I'm not sure having summer tryouts so early in the season would work. We did it several years ago and the feedback from parents was that it was too early for the girls to decide if they would enjoy playing summer.<br><br>On another note...<br>I had the schedule about 95% done and I discovered a serious error. Rookie mistake. :(.<br><br>It forced me to have to start over. The good news I know what steps I need to take as I start over. The bad news is that the past 5 hours have been a waste.<br><br>My brain is fried. I will look at it early tomorrow and possibly during lunch. Sorry for the delay.

          If we can get more time at CP I say grab it.<br><br>I like the idea of not having to cancel games for summer tryouts. I think 5/18 is a good because it gives the girls a few weeks to play and see if they're interested in summer. I would have the younger girls (U10 and U12) early in the am though not the older girls, they like to sleep. My preference would be to have all the tryouts in one day but I guess you could have 2 different Sundays. Is Ray (or you Bill?) going to coach U18 again...real question will we have a U18 team this summer?<br><br>LMK if there's anything I can do to help you with the schedule today or I can proof the entire schedule tonight.

          Okay, the schedule has been created for all divisions.  The Excel is attached. Two tabs are identical in content but sorted differently:<b> 2014 Game by dates</b> and <b>2014 Game by team</b>.<br><br>I also imported the schedule into the website (yeah I am that confident ha!). It may be difficult to look at a team's schedule from the excel but you can look to see if I scheduled games during a blackout period, etc.  The website is best to look at the team by team schedule.  A few notes: <br><br><ul>
<li>Mondays are for practice and makeups across all divisions (99% of the time)</li>
<li>
<b>Freshwomen</b> - Games on 5/19 to pick up the no games on friday 5/23 due to Mday holiday</li>
<li>
<b>Freshwomen</b>  - No games on 5/31 due to Fresh skills event</li>
<li>
<b>Freshwomen</b>  - Game on Mon 6/9 instead of Tues 6/10 due to Milton Road Race and Playoffs</li>
<li>
<b>Freshwomen</b> - season continues until 6/14 (we can spare fields for them and it will not impact playoff scheduling - especially with playoffs starting on Sunday, 6/8)</li>
</ul><br>To look at the team schedules, log in and go to teams.  What to look for?<br><ul>
<li>Make sure no team plays 3 days in a row</li>
<li>Thinking of an All Star schedule of Fresh at 1, Soph at 2:30, Junior at 5 and Senior at 7:30 (truly under the lights)</li>
<li>Make sure on days when we have the all star game teams have ample time before their ASG (several hours if not more</li>
<li>We accommodate a lot of events so if you see a stretch with no games, there is probably a reason why - Mday, mother's day, Summer tryouts, etc.</li>
</ul><br>Comments are welcome.  Happy to change anything - major or minor tweets.  It's not perfect but I think it works.

          Reviewed everything and looked across both the spreadsheet and the website. <br><b>Fresh.</b><br><ul>
<li>All Fresh. teams have a Jr coaches meeting scheduled, wrong division and wrong time...need to fix.</li>
<li>All Fresh. teams play 12 games each.</li>
<li>Fresh. Athletics have 3 games in 4 days, I think that's a lot for a Fresh. team...what do you both think?</li>
</ul><b>Soph.</b><br><ul>
<li>All Soph. teams have a Jr coaches meeting scheduled, correct day but wrong time and wrong division...need to fix.</li>
<li>All Soph. teams play 12 games each.</li>
</ul><b>Junior<br></b><ul>
<li>All Jr teams have a Jr coaches meeting.</li>
<li>All Jr teams play 15 games each.</li>
</ul><b>Senior<br></b><ul>
<li>All Sr teams have a Jr coaches meeting scheduled, wrong division and wrong time...need to fix.</li>
<li>All Sr teams play 12 games each.</li>

          Yaz League starts 4/6 - weather permitting.<br><br>Cunningham hopes to open the fields on 4/1.  We cannot use them until we are told it is open.

          Bill what do you think about Fresh. playing 3 games in 4 days? If you and Kevin both think it's fine then leave it as is.
