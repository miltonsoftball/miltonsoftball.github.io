<li>Coaches mtgs and draft, let's talk at the next Exec BOD mtg. BTW I liked meeting the week before our reg. BOD mtg. want to keep it on Monday nights? I know Tues. are out for BV. Let's figure this out and schedule them. I can host as well.</li>

          Sure. That works out good because we don't have to rush. Mondays are fine with me. I can also host.

          I met with Dave Perdios early this morning. I asked about fields and here is response: <br>Quarry fields -out. Fully used by Quincy and baseball<br><br>Milton Acadamy (near pool). He will ask for practice openings. Said we had spots last year and didn't use them, which was not well received. Can be for practice only and can't get on field until 6:15 pm, so later in spring will allow more light time. <br><br>Elliot St field- out. Used by little league.  <br><br>Curry -we can pursue  with higher ups. <br><br>Batting cages at Gile. 1st one is for American Little league ( they had it built). 2nd one is open. No permits given, first come. We could start a practice using both, but could get kicked out of 1st one by LL., but might not be used that often.

          Great information.  Thank you.  <br><br>Not sure what the story is with Milton Academy but hopefully we can get another chance  I know we will use it.<br><br>In terms of the cages at Gile do you think we play nice and ask Milton National to maybe split days?  I do not have any connections with MNLL and I am not sure if this ask would be well received or upset them,  I also wonder how much (if at all) the Milton American uses the cages.

          In terms of our EOD meetings, I like idea Karen mentioned as well.  Most Mondays should work but for the next couple months we may need to meet a few times in between board meetings.  I'll toss out some dates for our next three meetings:<br><br>Sunday, 1/26 late morning/early afternoon?<br>Monday, 2/3 at 6p<br>Monday, 2/24 at 6p<br><br>Also, Karen do you want to firm up the board meetings at the library?<br><br>Let me know what you think.

          Library is booked on Mondays through April, I quit after that but I called Cunningham and we are all set for the following meetings:<br><ul>
<li>2/10</li>
<li>3/10</li>
<li>4/14</li>
<li>5/12</li>
</ul>6/9 is the road race so if we want to have the Open BOD meeting I can look at the library for that date. I did book Mon., 6/2 at Cunningham Hall just in case. LMK what date you want.<br><br>As for upcoming Exec BOD mtgs:<br><ul>
<li>1/26 after 12 noon is good for me. I have a 10 mile run that morning and will need to recover.</li>
<li>2/3 is good</li>
<li>2/24 is the day I come home from my half marathon so that is a no. I could meet Wed., 2/26 or Thurs., 2/27.</li>
</ul>

          I'm coaching Jilly in bball in a game at 12:30 on 26th, so would have to be earlier or later if that day. Other Mondays are fine with me. Good for you Karen with a 1/2 marathon. .. Very impressed.

          Unfortunately is doesn't look like I'll be around all star day, as Jilly has a tourney in RI that weekend. She also has one championship day but I can sneak away for some of that, probably second half of day.

          All of that looks good to me. I just cross referenced and you didn't schedule any games that day so I think it's fine. I don't care whether we have 4 in a row or 2 in the morning and 2 early evening. I would just have the younger kids early and the older kids later.
