    <p>FYI I reached out to MaryAnn Sullivan at the COA and the Milton Art Center (MAC).</p><p><br></p><p>MaryAnn doesn't think having meetings there is going to be an option, she thinks we will need to hire a janitor to open and close the building. She is checking with someone at town hall and will get back to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I sent an email to the MAC and have not heard anything back from them yet.</p><p><br></p><p>For now we will have to stay at Cunningham Hall unless you have any other ideas. I will send out a reminder to the BOD today and Kevin you can post the agenda when it's available.<br></p>

          <p>I sent Jen and Kenny email reminding them that we have a meeting tomorrow night asking if they could come:</p><p><br></p><ul>
<li>Jen can come to the meeting tomorrow night, she'll be there early @7pm and will bring the parade stuff for Ted. I will be at CU Hall extra early so that I can get everyone to sign the card. Do you want me to pick up anything else?</li>
<li>Kenny can't come tomorrow night, his girls have a hockey game. I told him that our next meeting is 3/10.</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p>I went to SuperFlash on Friday:</p><ul>
<li>Catching equipment.--I picked up 2 little sizes, who has little ones that can try on the equipment for me...Freshman and Sophomore divisions?</li>
<li>Helmets--Chuck thinks they will be the same price, will confirm this week and we can get the same helmet.</li>
<li>Bags--Chuck can silkscreen (? name) the summer bags. I'm going to ask Dana to go to the storage and empty the summer bags and give them to me and I'll get them to SuperFlash.</li>
<li>Bats--Chuck doesn't now of anyplace that we can get bats custom ordered with MGS on them. Rick F. was looking into this as well.</li>
<li>Bags to purchase--where do we want to get the bags we need to replace Spring rec league bags? I can't recall ordering the summer bags from SuperFlash. We can talk at the meeting tomorrow night.</li>
<li>Visors vs baseball caps--Chuck thinks that the price is about the same but he does not know of any softball leagues that play with baseball caps vs visors. He suggested that we figure out if it's an age-related issue and maybe we get baseball caps for the Freshman division and then go to visors. What do you think?</li>
</ul><p><br></p><p>Se you tomorrow night.</p>

          Thank you for the update.<br><br>What are your thoughts about recognizing Jen's work over the last few years?  We have the gift card and card.  Anything else?

          <p>Didn't you mention creating some type of certificate for both Jen and Kenny? I know we did that for Ray, Alyse and Eileen when they stepped down.</p><p><br></p><p>As for anything else, I know for Ray and Alyse (Eileen couldn't come that night) I made a few desserts and choc. dipped strawberries but it was going to be their last meeting that they attended. What do you think about flowers for Jen? I can run to Milton Marketplace and get one of their premade arrangements? Or I know she loves the Gingerbetty gingerbread cookies I could get a few bags of those for everyone to have one or just one package for her with or without the flowers. I don't think she needs to stay for the meeting (and she probably doesn't want to).</p><p><br></p><p>I work from home we have no sports so I have time to do whatever we need. LMK what you both think.</p>

          <br>I think Gary did the certificates.  I can try to pull something together if you think it's worth having.  LMK what you think.<br><br>The cookies sound like a good idea.

          I heard back from the MAC (Milton Art Center) and they are willing to allow us to meet at their facility (old library near the Shell gas station). Do we want to try it? I know that the parking is tough and she said that it will be on a monthly notice, I wouldn't be able to book all our meetings there depending on their class schedule.<br><br>What do you think?

          If they have a room that works for our group, then I think it's worth trying for one meeting.

          Let's have the 3/10 meeting at CU Hall and Bill you can run it (you'll be the next President, not me : D ).<br><br>I'll see if I can't book the 4/14 meeting at the MAC and we can see if we like it there. I will confirm later.
