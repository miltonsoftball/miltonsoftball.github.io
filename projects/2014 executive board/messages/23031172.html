        <div class="content">
          After locking down the last open Freshwomen head coach, the assignments came together well.<br><br>I have a couple of emails out to parents who requested a girl who is not playing and asked if they had any other choices.  I also learned one girl decided not to play as well as removed a registration from a girl in Ontario. :)<br><br>The assignment tab is the tab to review.  The other tab is a download from the website that has not been altered and can be a quick point of reference.  I have some color coding that should help (see the color code key on the right under the team lists.  <br><br>Things to check for when reviewing the document:<br><ul>
<li>Coaches have their daughter on the team</li>
<li>Returning players on the correct team when possible (need to look at rosters from 2013 to compare (I have bolded returning players where I could). We did contract three teams</li>
<li>All players have been assigned</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from the registrations</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from wecare (check folder in email)</li>
</ul><br>Feel free to post comments here or edit the excel.  Either works.<br><br>Thanks for your help with this!<br><br>Kevin

          Crossed checked all the data. Only missed assignments were when girls requested didn't sign up (many). I'm assuming 1. Sally Driscoll coaching Phillies is a maiden name and daughter is on team. 2. Adam Ross from we care conversation decided not to coach or didn't have a spot? Thats all I noticed. Great job as usual Kevin.

          Awesome! <br><br>1. Yes, Sally's Maiden name is Driscoll and her daughter's last name is Shannon (this is my college friend).<br>2. Adam Ross is Adam Gondelman.  He registered as Gondelman so not sure why his email is Ross. <br><br>We had 5 girls register in the last 3 days - probably a result of the coaches receiving the email and sharing that they are coaching.  I was able to fulfill all 5 requests with a little work.  <br><br>The updated (final) excel doc is attached.  I know it's a pain but if anyone can compare the excel to the rosters on the website, it would be a good QA check.<br><br><b>Karen</b> - you can get the roster headcount from the <b>Division and Teams</b> link in the admin.  It's a way t see it all on one screen.<br><br>Thanks!
