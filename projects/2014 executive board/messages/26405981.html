    Hi Karen-<br><br>I went ahead and downloaded the summer registration data and formatted it into the Excel document we used last year.  <br><br>We are in great shape.  We are missing info from 5 girls.  We have two teams that are complete.  I<b> did not </b>go through the team lists and assign numbers.  I figured you have the data you pulled and have a system in mind. The info from the registration is in the Excel but for team we need to make sure that the numbers do not conflict (even if they are not ordering an uniform).  Feel free to reach out tonight if you have questions.<br><br>The document is as of 5/29 at 11:40 AM.

          Ashley Vaughn 1st choice is #9. Should I ask Ed if Mckenzie cares between 14 or 8?
