  <div class="content">
    I spoke to Dirt Dawgs today. We will be getting confirms on the team clinics for freshman and sophomore, which will be weekend mornings of 4/12 and 4/19 for a block of about 4 hours for each division. Not final yet because of question of either Sat or Sunday for one of weeks. When final, I will schedule directly with coaches. Also sent note to TJO requesting interest and slot for a group clinics for senior division coaches and teams. Lastly, will schedule Junior slots over probably 3 weeknights at Dirt dogs in mid April.

          This is great.  Let's get them on the team schedules once they are set.  If you need help with assignments, let me know.  Happy to help.

          Sure that would be great. See email just forwarded. We just need to figure out how to assign 9 teams into 4 hours for fresh women.   think we should ask the coaches for expected attendance or just wing it and start with 3 teams on the early slot?

          What if you had a sign-up sheet tonight at the event?  <br><br>List each time slot and the max number of teams.  <br><br>You can add three times into the first slot.  It will be fine.

          So far for freshman clinics next Saturday; Phillies 9am, Angels and DBacks 10:00am, Athletics 11am, Marlins 12:00. I guess u wasn't very clear, DBacks called DD to schedule themselves. I'm calling DD to let them know to have coaches let us know.

          Fresh women Cardinals want 12:00. That leaves 3 teams with slots available for at least one at 9, at least one at 11, then third team could be at any time making a third team for that slot, probably slotting the last respondent at 9am would be fair to others. Kevin, should I notify confirms now for those who responded so they can plan or send notice out via system or both?

          Sophomore addition Athletics and Peter Mullen at 11. Let's give Soph. Rays 9am and Nationals at 11. That leaves 1 solo slot at 12. I'll email confirms to coaches and reach out to 3 freshman and 1 Soph team that hasn't responded. Getting a 3 hour slot with DD finalized in next day or 2. Will give TJo one more call on seniors.

          It may be too late now but I just realized the Junior and Senior clinics conflict with the Pitching Clinic. Do we know how many kids this affects?

          Crap, I forgot too. At keat one on my team and Laurie's kids that I know of. I really can't change them at this point. Maybe we can have Janelle do another session and absorb cost for those that miss or give them a refund for session.

          What's the cost of the clinic per session? Cutting a small check might be the easiest way.

          It's not a cost issue, that's $20 each for 7 kids affected, it's not delivering the product. I spoke to Gary last night and we are going to start with Janelle, asking if she can push out  a week. After that I will call the individuals involved and try to work it out. On first session, only affected are Shawn Wards kids and the fourth grader on my team playing up. On second session it's Laurie's kids and 2 others.

          Janelle has agreed to have a makeup pitching clinic for those affected by tomorrow night on Wednesday May 21 at 6:00 pm on outfield at Kelly. No scheduling conflicts that I see.  Only 4 or possibly 6 girls are eligible, so not sure if you want to put it on site or not? Would be nice to put reminders in place though.

          May 21. Wednesdays are her best night and there were schedule conflicts with games before then. The last scheduled session is a week from tomorrow the 23rd. Only one session for makeup from 6-7. Most girls in first session are unaffected by tomorrow night and will go as planned.

          Clinics went well tonight. For Jr, division, every team was well represented and with coaches. Avg of probably 8-9 girls per team. Couple head coaches didn't make it, but had at least 2 assistants in their place. Good structure with Don, Mike Kinsella, and pitching coach Erin. Also saw Brian after his senior clinic. He said TJO's also did a very good job. They had about 28 girls show up, had a lot of space, and good varied instruction, including time doing hitting practice. Let me know if you get any feedback either way from anybody.

          Mitch and Caitlin went and both said it was well worth their time. Mitch said it was well organized too. Only coaches that were not there was Dbacks so Ted and Dan Rose and only 2 kids for their team. Every other team had @ 6-8 kids per team.

          To be fair to Ted, he was with Gary representing us at the Hoch meeting in Mansfield. Dan showed up at TJO for his 8pm session. A little disappointing that he couldn't at least show up at TJO for a while first. Actually only Jr head coach that didn't show was Shea, but Mike OToole and I believe 2 other assistants showed for their 8pm slot.

          Sophomore this Saturday still to come, but I agree. Next year I would like to have these all planned out and scheduled In the winter before teams are even selected. More than 1 pitching clinic indoors. 8 week Sunday night clinics, team clinics, a couple levels of follow up pitching levels, and anything else we think of.
