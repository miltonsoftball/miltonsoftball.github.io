    <p>Hi Bill/Karen -</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you feel we have a board involvement issue?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Gary - clinics?</p>
<p>Nick - Sponsors, scholarship?</p>
<p>Calece - Treasurer</p>
<p>Rich - Umpires</p>
<p><b>Shawn -</b></p>
<p>Ted - Summer, parade, scholarship</p>
<p><b>Brian -clinics?</b></p>
<p><b>Dana - equipment?</b></p>
<p><b>Lloyd - some PR?</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Am I missing anything? In my opinion, the board members in <b>bold</b> could step it up or need to be more involved. What do you think?  Does Ted have too much on his plate?  He didn't seem to happy with his name on the All-Star but I went back to the committee document and his name was next to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, <b>Shawn</b> has been MIA for at least 4 meetings in a row (or maybe 4 out of 5).  Do we do anything?  <b>Brian</b> said he is away the weekend of the all-star game but couldn't he still be involved in the planning aspect?  Dana seems to work better when he is asked to do things? Does he need more assignments?  Lloyd seemed to step up with helping out with the All-Star Cookout?</p><p><br></p><p>What do you think?</p>

          I agree. Dana needs a little prodding. Ted is truly busy I think and has the summer on him with his kid not playing or him coaching it now. Shawn is away a lot for work during week but we're not going to change that. Brian and myself could certainly help out with planning even if we're not there for all star. Want me to give him a nudge? If Dana is around he should help there also. Going to need cooks/preps.  to replace Kenny and me sometimes. Lloyd will step up if he can I think.

          Yes I think we have an issue. I agree everyone wants to help but only when they are called out publicly and asked specifically to do something, it doesn't seem like anyone's volunteering to own items.<ul>
<li>Shawn is on scholarship with Ted and I but he is travelling so much and been MIA. We are meeting Thursday night 8:30pm and will have winners by the end of the night. Bill...LMK the schools of the applicants as soon as you can so we can figure out when their award ceremonies are being held. Thank you!</li>
<li>Dana is not proactive and doesn't lead. After working with him on the Equipment he will do something but you have to ask him to do it and then follow-up with him to make sure that it's done. I will drive the summer equipment and make sure that we're organized for it.</li>
<li>All Star Day, didn't Ted own that last year? at least organizing the entire day and filling out a matrix as to who would do what when? I agree that others can help him plan and organize the day even if they can't be there the day of the event.</li>

          I like the design I say we switch up the colors and get fluorescent/neon colors this year. The neon colors seem to be very popular today. I have a call into Chuck at SFlash, he needs to call me back.<br><br>As for numbers, we need to figure out how many girls per team and how many shirts I need to order.<br><ul>
<li>Sophomore--7 teams...if we have 3 per team that's only 21 and if we have 4 per team that's 28...what do you think?</li>
<li>Junior--6 teams...4 per team for a total of 24 and 12 per team to play</li>
<li>Senior--5 teams...5 per team for a total of 25 and 12/13 per team to play?</li>
</ul>We want to go higher rather than lower right, in case someone can't make the game and there are enough players on the field?<br><br>Kevin...can you attach the artwork for me and I'll email it to Chuck, thanks!

          Kevin<br>Re tents...I don't want to post this publicly but we lost 2 tents last year and we should replace them this year. I know one was Bill's, not sure who owned the 2nd tent. How do you want to handle this? I can ask Dana to go out and purchase 2 new tents. What do you think?

          I think one may have been the leagues.  Yes, we should replace them.  Bill may want a specific one so maybe we cut a check.  We should replace the leagues and maybe buy two.  Red would be ideal.

<li>Sophomore-- 4 per team</li>
<li>Junior--4 per team</li>
<li>Senior--5 per team </li>

          Tents--Bill do you want the league to cut you a check? I'll ask Dana to purchase 2 tents for the league, preferably red and whatever the price is I'll have Calece cut Bill a check for the one that was damaged last year. Bill if you want us to purchase you a tent let me know and I'll have Dana get 3 tents.<br><br>All Star T-Shirts--I talked to Chuck not a problem to get 3 different neon colors (yellow, orange and he's looking into a 3rd color) and cost is @$8 per shirt. Are you both okay with neon colors? Artwork looks great! LMK and I will order:<br><ul>
<li>Soph--4 x 7 = 28 shirts</li>
<li>Jr--4 x 6 = 24 shirts</li>
<li>Sr--5 x 5 = 25 shirts</li>
<li>As for the Freshwoman--quantity is 107 kids. Chuck said he could do a white shirt with one color for @$6 per shirt. Do we have Janelle's artwork? If it's multi-color then the cost goes up per color. Should I talk to Nick off line about this and figure out what to order. LMK your thoughts.</li>
</ul><br>Pennies for Tryouts--I texted Gary this morning and he didn't look last night but will today. I told him I need an answer tomorrow am and if he doesn't have them I will order with Chuck tomorrow. Cost for 30 shirts is $180 (I did research on the web and the price is anywhere between $4-$8 each but they don't have numbers). I say we just get them from Chuck and if I order them tomorrow he can have them ready for me on Saturday.<br><br>Measuring Tape for Fields--Chuck has never ordered them but will let me know what he has later today. I researched online and there are lots of options and different prices, I need help picking one out. LMK what you both think or one of you and I'll just order 4 of them, one for each field to be left in the equipment box.<br><br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.kudosports.com/Champro_Open_Reel_Tape_Measures_p/A170-175.htm?gclid=CJ704pShqb4CFdLHtAodvkcAAQ" target="_blank">http://www.kudosports.com/Champro_Open_Reel_Tape_Measures_p/A170-175.htm?gclid=CJ704pShqb4CFdLHtAodvkcAAQ</a><br><br>Kevin...<br>White or Black shirts to sell at All Star Day--with MGS new logo on front upper left, same ones that a few of us got last year because we had to wait for our polos, @$6 each for quantity of 100. Do you want me to talk to Calece off line about this, LMK.

I left Giants game to drive to Whitman for SSSSL meeting with Ray, only to get there and find out they cancelled it on website for bruins game.  I'm not that concerned about tent, but if you must, it was only a 10 by 10 that goes for around $100. Don't worry about boat cooler, it just lost a hinge and was old anyway.

Bad news is Mitch needs to take Aidan to golf so I have to take her to Durfee MA to compete. I will get to Gile asap when I get home.

          I gave banner to Dana at coaches party at View. I'm away this weekend but will get on cookout stuff when I get back. If my u18s are having trouble requesting their number as it's showing as taken, I'm having them put t a dummy # and a note.  Ex Kate puts in 66 but puts a note to have 6. Congrats on Rebecca. .

          Burgers, dogs, rolls, chips,<br>Sometimes paper products.<br><br>Quantities vary based on weather,etc. but my thought was to have two cooking sessions.  Last year's Basecamp project (under archived) should have the quantities we ordered last year.

          Yes, but we have typically split it between pizza for opening day and cookout. We need to decide if we need $500 worth of food based on expected volume, weather, etc.

          Weather is chance is showers 30% and not too hot, 65 or so. I don't think we're going to get a carryover credit from Pat for next year if he sponsors again ,so why don't we just ask for more items, like plates and paper products this year. Whatever we ask for, I should do by tomorrow.

          Good news and bad news.<br><br>Good news is that Fontbonne softball won today and advanced to the 2nd round.  The bad news is that the game is at 3pm in Dedham.  With both girls on the team (and possibly the last game for one of them), I am attending.  I can work setup and the Freshwomen event, but at 2 I will need to leave.<br><br>I can come back after the game - probably around 5:30/6.<br><br>Calece and I are in good shape with the planning aspects of the Freshwomen event - but we need more volunteers.  The response from the older girls has been weak (only 2).  I am also going to see if Nick and Shawn can help out at this event.
