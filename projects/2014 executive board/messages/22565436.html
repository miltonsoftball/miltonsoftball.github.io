          Attached are the 2014 Draft Guidelines.  This has been updated to reflect a few changes (i.e. we are not completely redrafting, maximums of each grade per team based on head count, etc.). <br><br>Please review in detail.  Feel free to edit/comment/etc.  I have found that if we give this careful thought we can refer to it on draft night should any questions or challenge may come up.<br><br>Ideally, I would like to send this out to the Senior Coaches when I email them about the Senior Coaches Meeting/ Coaches Appreciation night but if it needs to wait it's fine.

          I just proofed the Sr team listing with the Sr teams from last year and it is accurate. There are 36 girls eligible for the draft but not really because we need to assign a few girls to teams:<br><br><ul><li>Alison Brink should be on the Phillies with her Dad Josh.</li></ul><ul>
<li>If Dan Rose is the Dbacks Asst Coach then Kristin Rose should be assigned to the Dbacks.</li>
<li>Caroline Queally's mom volunteered to be an asst coach, do we want to assign her to a team so that we can have an asst for a team that doesn't have one?</li>
<li>If Smokey is the Rays Asst Coach then Kate Rulon should be assigned to the Rays.</li>
<li>Larry Foley looks like he volunteered to be an asst coach so his daughter Ciara would be assigned to the team that Larry can assist with. Laurie Jensen or John Howley's team?</li>
<li>Genevieve Connelly...I can't recall did we talk about this mom or dad coaching? Laurie Jensen or John Howley's team?</li>

          I didn't but just did now so as I see it there is only one issue...Kate Rulon is NOT on the Rays, you'll need to assign her to be with her dad Smokey (he is assigned as Asst Coach).<br><br>As and Rockies do not have Asst Coaches, looks like there are a few options. Should we try to figure this out now or let the draft happen?<br><ul><li>Caroline Queally's mom volunteered to be an asst coach, do we want to assign her to a team so that we can have an asst for a team that doesn't have one?</li></ul><ul>

</ul><br>I noticed Kristin Kubera is still assigned to the Rays and I know her mom sent in an email asking for her to be removed from that team.<br><br>Are there any other Sr team requests, to be removed from a team? If so we should do that before the draft.

          Larry Foley daughter Ashley in Junior you mean? Did Larry volunteer on registration, as I didn't see it when looked I spoke to him a couple weeks ago by chance. .  He was undecided about helping out, waiting to see what or if available. I can call him to feel him out if you guys want ? Is there specific team to have him assist with? He's been doing it a while and probably deserves to know situation rathere than assigning him. Thoughts?

          I read through draft guidelines and Karen's comments. I'm not sure there is a fairer way to have a draft than what is proposed. Some teams that probably will be weaker are teams that lost the most 8th graders the year before, completing a typical 2 year cycle. Assuming coach or coaches stay around both years, it should even out. One thing I do question is making catchers the automatic 2nd round pick. For example, Kate Rulon caught for us last year, did an ok job, but not sure I would make her an automatic 2nd round pick over a sure fielding shortstop   Not as familiar with Rose kid as much. Kate not a pitching prospect at this point. Maybe 3rd round or 10-15 overall? Does this help at all?

          Coaches could see them if they logged in but I am not too concerned if they do.  Rosters are never public to the general public.<br><br>I believe the rosters are all set for returning players or players of coaches. The next steps are to pull the stats together for the draft, share the draft list and update the draft rules.

          The draft guidelines document has been updated to reflect Karen's comments.  Karen - you had some very good points and I think I addressed your concern with the draft order. Happy to discuss if you'd like.<br><br>I am wondering if we meet/discuss the draft in advance of next week's meeting.  Maybe we could do later this week?  Or maybe a call would work too.  I want to make sure we are all in agreement with the process.

          Hi there-<br>I have been working on the draft documents and they are in decent shape.  I have attached 2 docs:<br><ul>
<li>Draft Guidelines</li>
<li>DraftBoard (rankings, draft board and draft list)</li>
</ul><br>Couple of notes:<br><ul>
<li>All pitching data from website is in</li>
<li>Ratings data from jr coaches is in</li>
<li>Noted if they played summer or pre-season clinics</li>
<li>No data for Queally (out with injury)</li>
<li>No data for Pirate 8th graders.  Maybe we ask the coaches during the draft to rate them?  Do any of them pitch?)  There are some gems in this group so it would be great to get data prior to Tue?  <b>Any suggestions?</b>
</li>
<li>No data on two girls (step sisters) who did not play last year</li>
<li>We missed this earlier but two 7th graders (who are sisters) have a sister on the A's.  They are automatically on A's but need to determine what round (brown box)</li>
<li>Some odd ratings by coaches--- high rating as a pitcher but player has a low number of pitched innings?  </li>
<li>Brink rating seems very low (but was also done by her dad)</li>
</ul><br>Feedback welcome.  Thanks.

          My gut is that all Rangers are graded a little higher than they should be and all angels( Mike Kinsella ) are graded conservatively.  I know mike well and have no problem reaching out to him to get more accurate assessments. I'm confident in my grading of giants and now feel more confident with Kate Rulon as 2nd round.

<li>As for all the girls that we don't have ratings for, I think we should come up with some type of assignment of data and have the coaches agree. If they don't agree then the three of us take what they have to say and decide on a number.</li>
<li>Mike Kinsella wouldn't have assigned the value for the Angels, he definitely didn't coach last year and not sure about the year before.</li>

          We have data for the 8th grade pirates from last year's draft.  We could use that and discuss it at the draft with coaches.  Thoughts?<br><br>Also, MIke Kinsella coached the Junior Angels last year with Mike Papile.

          Yes, Mike coached against us with his niece. I asked him tonight about his graduates. Other than Bella Cagnarno that we know about, other players from angels are ok players but none are pitchers or catchers.

          As for Brian and his player list, I asked him where he got it and he told me by searching the website. He would request his roster from last year and from there was able to search others teams and rosters. He then just listed last years 6th graders and made a list. I was under impression that other than a few of us, coaches could only access their own rosters? Brian was at all the clinics with his daughter and helped me sign in girls as well. However I'm not sure this gave him an advantage over Josh or any other coach who could attend the clinics and observe the workouts as well. Also, only some of the  draft eligible girls attended the clinics.  Josh didn't seem upset , as we all shot the breeze for a while together.

          Okay, I have been working with League Athletics and there was a security issue with the site.  It took them a while to figure it out but they said they have since resolved it.  <br><br>A coach cannot see any roster but their own.<br><br>Maybe when we are not getting much feedback on a player form the coaches, we can ask Brian his opinion (especially if its someone who has been at the clinic).

          Kevin I can't remember about last year but didn't we split up what each of us would do before the draft started? I recall keeping track of how many 7th and 8th graders were on a team. Should we include that in the MS Excel spreadsheet next to the person's name? I think I kept track of it hardcopy. I also recall stopping the draft every once in a while and making everyone update the printout of what kids were gone (drafted to teams). Should we discuss this online or just arrive early and we can talk about it...what do you think?

          I missed Dans email ? I can get there early tomorrow if that helps? . I got the senior umpires checks from Calece and will bring. Brian emailed me with a good catch that senior distance to mound should be 43 feet not 40. Also, shouldn't the senior rules say lead and steal on release this year ? I thought that's our big change on that end. Item 1 on base running and 1. On stealing.

          What if for example a team already has 6 8th graders and when their pick comes up they want to take a Pirate? would they be allowed to only if there wasn't a team already with 7 8th graders?

          Correct.<br><br>Once the first team has 7 8th graders, the max any other team can have is 6.  For a 2nd year coach, there is a strategy to grab an 8th grader.  For a coach coaching for two years, they need to decide to they want a 7th grader for 2 years or an 8th grader for only 1.

          Of draft eligible girls, couple parents who might help him if drafted by him is maybe Canavans dad Paul or more likely Queallys's mom, who offered to help us last year, but the daughter got injured and didn't play. I tried to look at holdover Athletics to see if I knew any and I can't get into last years spring roster.

          On equipment, didn't we talk about ordering one face mask per team and putting them in each bag if desired by pitcher or infielder? I know that probably can't happen at this point unless we call and he can get them in a couple days?

          I know that I spoke to SuperFlash about them because I have 2 photocopies of different masks. I also recall a conversation at a BOD meeting but I don't have any action item noted in the minutes. If I dropped the ball my apologies!<br><br>I don't think it's too late to order them if we want them. The two that Chuckk game me information on were:<br><ul>
<li>Champro and that runs $24<br>

<li>FaceFirst FACE 1 Fielder's Mask had different models ranging from $25 to $33 each. Looks like they have 2 sizes (11 and younger &amp; 12 and up). Most of them have wire and one has plastic cage.<br>
