  <div class="content">
    I just tallied all the uniforms and created a spreadsheet, the only one I added 2 extra uniforms for was the Senior teams. We have 5 teams with 63 registered and I am ordering 65 shirts.<br><br>Do we think that the numbers for the Fresh., Soph. and Jr. are final? Can I order the uniforms? We can always order late registrations later.<br><br>LMK your thoughts, thanks!

          Two outstanding items that I hope to have resolved Wed morning:<br><br><ul>
<li>Spring team decision in the Juniors</li>
<li>Assigning a girl on the waitlist in the Freshwomen Division.  </li>

          Yes I will give SFlash the numbers today after Kevin let's me know if and where Spring is playing as well as the last minute Fresh addition. It will take a time for the shirts to come in and hopefully we'll have all the sponsors set up by then.

          I emailed it to both of you.  Rosanne Spring reached out to Karen probably around the time of my email to her.  I am not sure we need to post the details of the conversation here but maybe Karen can email you or talk to you regarding the extent of the conversation.

          <p>Bill I can give you more detail tonight but basically there's a misunderstanding. Roseanne Spring started by talking about a second issue from a few years ago and I wouldn't entertain that conversation. I told her that I would not discuss several years ago with her not today. </p><p><br></p><p>Roseanne Spring misunderstood that Nick offered to put her daughter's friend on the Cubs. She never would have asked the friend's daughter if she wanted to be on the Cubs if she couldn't be placed on that team. Roseanne Spring is not happy but I told her several times that it's a misunderstanding! There is no agenda, Kevin told her that we are all volunteers and have put a lot of hours into placement. Kevin and I both offered to move Gianna Spring from the Cubs to the friend's team (Gianna Gallagher on the Rangers). I said that the only reason why her daughter was put on the Cubs is that she is a returning player, she was late and she was put back on her team. I also said that it wasn't fair to Gianna Gallagher who requested another friend and the friend requested her. She said that the friend's mom didn't request anyone. I told Roseanne to have Rose Gallagher call me directly and that I would discuss it with her. I was not having a conversation with her about another child's registration.</p><p><br></p><p>5 minutes later...Rose Gallagher called me and I pulled up her registration and went over it with her. She does not remember putting in a request (if she did it would have been for Gianna Spring) but I told her that whoever filled out the registration form filled in Lindsey Dunn's name. It is not in our interest and we do not edit people's registration forms. And (oh by the way) Lindsey Dunn requested Gianna Gallagher. So fortunately or unfortunately Gianna Gallagher and Lindsey Dunn are together.</p><p><br></p><p>New information...Rose Gallagher went on to say that her daughter was sad because this was the 2nd year that she was supposed to be on the Cubs team. Last year she was put on the team and at the last minute she was moved to another team because someone registered late and was put on the Cubs. (Not quite sure what this is all about and where she got that information but I didn't touch it... I told her that I know none of that.) For Gianna Gallagher she wanted Ted Carroll to be her coach this year. He coached her last summer. I pulled her registration form and she requested last spring to be with Ted's daughter Marilyn. Marilyn did not request anyone except the Cubs team.</p><p><br></p><p>FYI...Rose Gallagher said that she was on a BOD for sports and understands how teams are made and totally understands about balancing teams and so on but (with a big huge but)...</p><p><br></p><p>Last but not least...Rose Gallagher did ask me if someone quit from the Cubs team if her daughter could switch from her current team to the Cubs. I said we would deal with that when it happens. Oh dear God!</p><p><br></p><p>Ok so forget about giving you additional detail I think this about sums it up.</p>

          I am trying to nail down these late requests... there are three lingering (see wecare).  As soon as we have them confirmed and paid, we can update the counts.  I already added the sophomore sisters to the Dodgers - we will need to order two additional uniforms for this team.

          I know we don't have an official agent program this year, but Jillian would be happy to play up on Rays if they needed somebody and there was no Giants conflict, and Brian would be as well. Karen, are you getting him 12 uniforms anyway?

          Sure. Makes sense. it would be nice to have the agent program again but I understand its a time and logistic  issue for whoever has to deal with it last minute on weekdays. I wonder if Dana is free at all late afternoons? I'm sure Rays are not the only senior team that might need help at some point this year.

I just added the shirt back in and sent the list back to Chuck (he will have the extra shirt).<br><br>I couldn't go to SF yesterday and can't today so will be going tomorrow to pick up the visors and the masks.
