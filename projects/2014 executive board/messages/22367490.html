    I connected with Cathy Smith about PCA.  Too detailed for Basecamp but we can discuss when we talk/meet.  I think a short term step is to promote the upcoming events to our coaches and parents.

          In the short term, are both of you okay with me sending out an email blast to the entire softball list promoting these workshops?

          Absolutely, I think this is a huge step forward for us being "professionals" for a non-profit sports organization. (Not just for softball but for the entire town of Milton!)

          I committed to sending the local group a check for their efforts with the PCA workshops.  What do you think for an amount?  I was thinking of $300 but I can be swayed in either direction.<br><br>What do you think?

          I think $300 is fine. I went to the parents meeting and bumped into Ted.
