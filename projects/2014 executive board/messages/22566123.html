          Should I contact Larry Foley and see if he's interested in assisting Dana or Bernie?

          Okay, so the Dan Rose Division (sorry, I mean the Junior Division) is ready for review.  This one is a tough one.  Dan Rose had a total of 22 players at one point. <br><br>The key with this is to look at the <b>Important Notes </b>tab.  You will see some requests and pairings and what decision I made to get to where we are.  I am open to ideas but I wanted to at least provided some background as to why I did what I did.<br><br>Dan Rose/Cubs have 15 players - one of whom is a 4th grader.  I emailed Dan and Ted and said that he has 14 and if he wants Neret it will be 15.  I told him I think it's too many but I left it up to him.  I am NOT getting into a roster review with him where he can decide who he wants and doesn't want.<br><br>The assignment tab is the tab to review.  The third tab is a download from the website that has not been altered and can be a quick point of reference. I have some color coding that should help (see the color code key on the right under the team lists.  <br><br>Things to check for when reviewing the document:<br><ul>
<li>Coaches have their daughter on the team</li>
<li>Returning players on the correct team (need to look at rosters from 2013 to compare (I have bolded returning players where I could)</li>
<li>All players have been assigned (Neret is an open item right now)</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from the registrations</li>
<li>All requests have been fulfilled from wecare (check folder in email)</li>
</ul><br>Feel free to post comments here or edit the excel.  Either works.<br><br>Thanks for your help with this!<br><br>Kevin<br>

          Good idea on Larry, but let's wait until the rosters are nailed down.  Right now his daughter is on Shea's team.  He may be able to help Shea since his assistant has moved on.

          Went through last years rosters. Look ok, but disturbing how many 5th graders from last year are not returning. 14 in all.  One would think the transition year to senior would be jumping off point. Couple things I notice. I believe Marilyn Carroll is a 5 th grader this year, think she might have played up. Also, first girl that asked to play up with Giants, Caroline Canovan is not listed on our roster, only her friend, Lily Baldwin is.

          Good catch on Canavan.  I assigned her to Giants.  Moved O'Toole to another team to balance numbers.<br><br>Do you find that all the requests from registration were covered (besides Rose)?<br><br>Updated version attached.

          Okay, this division was a nightmare.  The Cubs (Rose) initially had 22 requests.  We got it down to 15 but then a girl who's parents are a sponsor signed up this week.  We could not fulfill a request by the Pelton's but I placed them on a team with a few players they placed with last year and have a record of good coaching.<br><br>The players have been assigned to the teams on the website.  Worth a double check but hopefully it's in good shape.<br><br>I do have a minor issue with a sponsor's daughter wanting to add a friend of her daughter to the Cubs (this sponsor just signed up her daughter Friday). I am working through it with Nick.

          I have a problem with it as well. There has plenty of time  to sign up, but to sign up 2 weeks  late then request a friend is a bit much, sponsor or not.

          I checked the Junior spreadsheets against web rosters. All correct, but looks like teams are a bit unbalanced, with Giants, Angels, and Cubs with 14, and Cardinals and Rangers with 12. Looks like you added back O'Toole to Giants from Rangers or whoever she was shifted earlier.
