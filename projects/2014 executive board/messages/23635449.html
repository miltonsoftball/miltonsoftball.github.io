    Here are the 2 masks. My Caitlin has one and hates it and won't wear it so I don't trust her opinion.<br><br>Bill...I know your Jillian wears one, would you pick the one we should order?<br>Kevin...I agree I think one per team for Jr and Sr teams so that would be a total of 11 masks. Do you agree Bill?<br><br>LMK and I can order them with SuperFlash and we can distribute them with the uniforms in a few weeks.

          If we order the masks for the Soph (7), Jr (6) and Sr (5) that would be 18 masks at $25 for a total $450. I can talk to Chuck today LMK if I should order them. (My vote is yes)

          Do you want to get the stickers to me or to someone who can be there early so we can add them to the helmets before the coaches arrive?
