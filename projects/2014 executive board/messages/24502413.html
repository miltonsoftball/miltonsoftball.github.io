    Two things:<br>First, I want to ask everyone on the BOD to wear their black MGS polo for the day of the parade, are the both of you ok with this? I think it's a more professional appearance. I also think that the day of the parade we should recognize the BOD just thanking them for all their hard work. Maybe just saying their names?<br>Second, do we want to purchase black t-shirts (not the polos) for all the coaches this year? I just tallied them and there are 65 for this spring. If I recall correctly the shirts were @$10 each and I am not sure when Chuck would be able to get them to us but again I think it makes us look more professional as an organization.<br><br>What do you both think?

          Do you mean the black mesh coaches shirts? I'd be happy to wear it but depending on the weather we'll provably need something over it anyway, but good idea. T shirts are a good idea.

          I love the idea of t-shirts but can we get a sense of timing from Chuck?  If he can't have them until mid May or later would it still be worth it?<br><br>Also, we should only hand them out to coaches who have submitted their CORI form.  Or they get a shirt when they hand in their CORI.  We need to be protect ourselves in this regard.<br><br>Finally, in my opinion only coaches listed on the website as a coach or an assistant receive a t-shirt.  We will probably have a few "Can Mark get one, he helps out all the time?" requests and we need to manage to it.<br><br>Do all board members have the polo shirts (Calece and Lloyd)? Do board members need t-shirts since they have polos?

          Yes the black mesh coaches shirts from the summer.<br><br>Yes everyone on the BOD has one (I ordered and gave Calece one and Lloyd said he had one from coaching last summer).<br><br>I will post that we would like everyone to wear their shirt. I checked the 10 day forecast that goes to next Friday and it looks like starting Monday temps will be in the 60s Monday through Friday so hopefully Saturday will be great weather for the parade (and for the shirts to be visible!).<br><br>I will talk to Chuck about black t-shirts and see what timeframe we're talking about. You are correct if we're talking early- to mid-May I say let's get them but if we're talking mid- to late-May I agree let's not get them. Something to think about for next year.<br><br>Do we want to order white t-shirts with the new logo to sell at the All Star game? I can ask Chuck for prices for those and then we can make a decision.
