  <div class="content">
    Attached is an excel document that summarizes and ranks each player by each summer team.  This is based on the evaluation data from the evaluators.  This will serve as the foundation for our discussion. <br><br>For reasons we can discuss, I think we need to start at the U18 level and work downward. This data should only be shared between the three of us.<br><br>Please review.

          Team Assignments for<b> U10, U12, U14 and U18</b> are on the website.  The teams, coaches and players are not public.  You can only see them when you log in.<br><br>U12 may need some changes:<br><ul>
<li>
<b>Shiffman</b> - may or may not play</li>
<li>
<b>Bridget Lee</b> and <b>Meghan Lee</b> - sisters both U12 eligible.  Should be on same team.  My vote is to put them on U12 B (Ward/Kelly).  Gives them another pitcher.  Hard to justify putting the 16th ranked Bridget Lee on the A team</li>
<li>I suggest Lang goes to Dana's team (coaching support possibly) and also helps balance the numbers.  If Gayle reaches out we can decide /evaluate if Arden is A or B.</li>
</ul><br>Take a look and compare it to your notes.<br><br>Thanks!

          There are 2 Peltons, correct? If they decline will there be an opening for Noelle Chandler on 12B? So it's ok to email roster for U18 tonight or tomorrow? Went to SSSSL meeting last night. Can you add their website to summer travel section... And last years U18 to past winners:)
