          Can't open ad at moment, but Shawn Ward offering to take bulk of Kenny's job solves a big problem. Good personality for it.

          I agree.  But definitely could use additional support which we will pitch Nick and possibly Gary for,<br><br>I hope Shawn has the time as well.

          I spoke to Gary last night. He's not interested in more fundraising ((Kens job) with boosters and other things going on. Maybe continue with Hock while transitioning someone else in (I thought maybe Ted?), clinics, which he's been involved with this winter, and anything we you guys can think of.

          As a follow-up to our conversation a few weeks ago, I did some additional digging on the USPS EveryDoorDirectMail Service.  You can select a zip code as a starter.  From there, you are able to select neighborhoods you would like to target.  Neighborhoods are determined by the number of postal carriers required to delivery mail in a zip code.  Milton has over 30 neighborhoods.  When I selected all the Milton Neighborhoods, I could reach 9.195 addresses. <br><br>I could also overlay some demographics such as household income ranges, male/female, age, and if they had children.  I selected the children option.  Now although I CANNOT target JUST addresses with children, I am able to see what neighborhoods have a greater propensity for this criteria (see graphic).<br><br>If we were to target all 9,195 Milton/02186 addresses, it would cost $3,402.15 (37¢ per address).  A 2-3% response rate is the industry standard on direct mail.  This equates to 183 families registering to play softball.  It's not a realistic expectation because I think for a lot of our addresses/households the mailer would be irrelevant.<br><br>If we could identify neighborhoods that had low softball registrations, maybe we could target <b><i>those</i></b> neighborhoods.  This got me thinking that it would be interesting to see on a map the neighborhoods of the 381 girls who played softball in 2013 (see attached).  In studying this map, it seems like there are two neighborhoods that are low with softball players: <br><ol>
<li>Area between Brush Hill and Truman Parkway</li>
<li>Indian Springs</li>
</ol><div>If you want to zoom in and interact with the map, click here:<br><a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://batchgeo.com/map/ce41eb13c65d620f731551854dcb875c" target="_blank">http://batchgeo.com/map/ce41eb13c65d620f731551854dcb875c</a><br><br>This would be about 500 homes at a cost of $185.  We would need 2 registrations to break even.  I am not sure we NEED to do it, but it's an option to consider.  <br><br>The turnaround time with the post office is about 10 business days.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

          I can speak to the neighborhood between brush hill and Truman as I live there. I don't think we'd get much bang as I think there are a lot of older families on the Milton side. Great  research work but I'm  not sure this would be worth the energy?

          Honestly, I don't think it's worth the money. Kevin if you feel strongly that we should do it and spend the $185 I am also fine with it and will support that decision. As always, great work!

          Thanks for your feedback.  I agree with both of you.  Something we can always revisit if we feel the need.

          I worked over the weekend and set up an experiment with Google Keywords.  Under a free promotion, we have purchased keywords so when someone in the Boston DMA (essentially metro Boston) searches for keywords we define on google.com, an ad for Milton Girls Softball will appear.  We only pay when someone clicks on it at a cost is 2¢ per click.  The cap is $1.25 per day and we have a free credit on the account to work from that will allow us to determine if this is a viable channel for us.  <br><br>In looking at our Google Analytics (web traffic), I think it may be something we continue to do.  I will post more details under a post we can share with the entire board.

          Great tool to have. What would our benefits be when someone outside of Milton finds us?

          That's the great think about this, the ad will ONLY display on google.com based on the location of the target we selected.  So, I selected a target audience of the Greater Boston area and they will be the only people who see the ad.  If someone was in Texas or Illinois, and typed in Milton Girls Softball, they would not see our ad.  They could see our organic/natural search listing but that is at no cost to us anyway.

          I extended it to Greater Boston because parents could be searching from work on their work Internet connections.  By selecting the greater Boston market, we have them covered.  I think it's safe to assume that all relevant searches for Milton Girls Softball would not happen from within the town border.

          Excellent. Hopefully we get more hits, more traffic, and make out banner ads more visible as well for our sponsors.

          Love the google idea and let's see what the cost looks like this year and see if it's worth the money (I think it will be). I think it's a GREAT tool and a bonus for the sponsors, can we add to the sponsor sheet?
