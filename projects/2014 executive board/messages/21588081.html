          <p>Just got off the phone with Chris Carr he is interested but wants to review an email from Nick and he wants to think it over before he says yes. He asked if we could follow up later this week, I will call him on Friday for an answer.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him that we are interested in doing the same type of event as last year. $500 in kind for food and drinks and he gets a full sponsorship and we would pay the balance that evening. As for the dates The View is available on Mon., 3/31 and Mon., 4/7. We will probably have to hold it inside because of the weather.</p><p><br></p><p>I will talk to Nick tonight and tell him that I will follow up with Chris later this week so that Chris only needs to deal with one of us from MGS.</p><p><br></p><p>Bill...do you know how much we paid for the rest of the event? I know we paid by check, if you don't I can email Calece LMK thanks!</p><p><br></p>

          <p>I have been playing phone tag with Shila at The View but will try to confirm today with her that we are all set for 3/31 for our event. What time do we want to have it? 7-9pm? I know last year we started at 7pm not sure if we had posted an end time.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a little confused with this was part of her email...</p><p><br></p><p>"We have availability here at The View for Monday March 31st 2014 for your Milton Girls Softball Fundraiser. Chris Carr has quoted you at $250.00 and he will be donating $500.00."</p><p><br></p><p>So I need clarification on what the $250 is for? When I talk to Shila I will offer The View 2 teams this year, one from last year that we owe and one for this year.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also trying to track Kenny down today because he called me while I was away.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

          Ok we are confirmed...Mon., 3/31 at The View starting at 7pm (I can be there at 6:30pm). We will do the same thing as last year, tickets for cocktails and we will only pay for those that we use. Chris is away until early March so Shila will confirm a menu (appetizers only) with me after he returns. Please let me know if you have any preferences (mine are those mini burgers).<br><br>Last year the total was $1046.40 and he gave us a $500 sponsorship so we wrote a check for $546.40. This year he asked us to commit to at least $250 over the $500 sponsorship and we can pay by check again.
