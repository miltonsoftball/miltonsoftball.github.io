    <p>Hey Dana and Rich -</p><p><br></p><p>Now that we have Gile and Kelly cleaned out, do you think the two of you could tag team and make sure each box across all four fields has the following prior to opening day on Saturday?</p><p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>2 batting tees (at least one but two would be ideal)</li>
<li>2 complete sets of bases (2 regular, 1 first base)</li>
<li>Practice balls</li>
<li>First Aid Kit</li>
<li>Umpire Bag (hanging)</li>
<li>Rake</li>
<li>Broom</li>
<li>2-3 bags of quick dry</li>
</ul><br>Please let me know if you can use any help.  Thanks!

          Dana/Rich,<br><br>Josh Brink volunteered to help.  He said he could go around and load some of the boxes but needs access to the equipment. Dana - can you connect with him?  His number is 617) 901-3819.  He is expecting your call. Thanks!
