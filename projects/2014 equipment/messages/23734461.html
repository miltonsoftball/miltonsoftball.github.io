          Very well- great support from much of the board - I believe 24 of 27 picked up their equipment including balls ,keys and score books. Only teams outstanding are Fresh- Royals ,Junior-Cards and Junior-Rangers I believe.

          Yes, I agree with Rich.<br><br>Thanks to Dana, Calece (and Loren), Rich, Brian, Lloyd and Nick for helping out getting the bags ready and helping with handing them out to coaches. Definitely the way to go each year.  Made the pickup process very smooth.<br><br>Dana - can you coordinate with the three teams that need to pick up equipment and schedule a time at Extra Storage that is convenient for you.  The contact info for each team is on the website.  <br><br>One of the teams missed the coaches meeting and we also need to give her a packet (Fresh Royals).  I left it with Rich so maybe it's with him or in the storage unit.<br><br>Thanks again to all who helped.

          Dana<br><br>I heard from Kevin that the last 3 teams picked up their equipment bags. Is there anything that the teams need from storage that they don't already have?<br><br>Did you get bags for the clipboards and are there any extra? I am going to need something to put the masks in. LMK<br><br>I am picking up the visors and masks from SF tomorrow and the uniforms next week so I will need to schedule a uniform pick up day and can get anyone anything that they need. LMK

          As far as field boxes, Gile equipment is moved to our box. There is a lot of random stuff in there including 3 hoses and many sets of bases. We could really use a single longer, more flexible hose that's fits that valve. Kelly is fine, Cunningham was empty as of last Thursday and haven't been to Andrews.

I can call them today and schedule them to come pick up the equipment.<br><br>Dana...can you drop off a key to my house 99 Nancy Road?<br><br>Dana and Rich...can you make sure that all the boxes are all set and ready to go for games next Saturday? We need tees in the Andrews and Kelly boxes for the Freshman division.<br><br>Anything else?

          Games start the 26th correct? Dana do we have what we need for the hitting tees? I have one in my garage I will put down Andrews this weekend but I believe we need some parts for ones in storage is that correct?

          Dana, there some spare equipment (helmets, catchers equip, balls,etc) in box at Gile that probably should be donated as well. It's clogging up some space in box and I think would just gather more dust there all season. Thanks
