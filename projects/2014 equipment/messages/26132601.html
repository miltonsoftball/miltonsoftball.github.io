    Dana and Rich...we need to think about a day and time when we can collect the equipment from the Spring coaches. Friday, 6/13 is a good date but not all of the bags will be ready to be returned because of playoffs. We could also wait until the week of 6/16 although summer starts that week. What do you both think?

          Did we settle on a day for this?<br><br>I would recommend that we use the same checklist we had when we handed out the equipment in April.  <br><br>We inventory all the bags that are coming in and tag them with the team name.<br><br>We should set a date and send out communication.  All teams across all divisions will be done by Sunday, June 15th.  So anytime the following week would probably work.

          We need to do drop off at the storage facility, too many bags. Summer pickup will be this weekend but I need to heat back from Chuck when I can pick up new equipment. I think summer coaches should keep their spring bags until summer bags are ready so they can practice.

          Dana and Rich...can you two take care of this? The equipment bags are back with the MGS logo on them. I will be going to SuperFlash Thursday and Friday to pick up all the summer equipment and summer uniforms. I will take care of organizing and labeling that and getting them to the coaches. LMK thanks!<br><br>Do we have MGS property equipment labels and the M stickers for the helmets in storage? LMK that too.

          Equipment drop-off was a great success.  For each bag we received, we made sure it had all the equipment that was initially provided.  We made note if something was missing.<br><br>Of the 29 bags, we have 22 are in the storage unit.<br><ul>
<li>2 bags were dropped off at Kevin's tonight.  I'll get them to the box in the next day or so (<b>Fresh Angels and Fresh Marlins</b>)</li>
<li>
<b>Sophomore Rays </b>(McNeely) - away will drop off to Kevin this weekend</li>
<li>Dana has <b>Junior Astros, Junior Angels </b>and<b> Senior Phillies </b>and will drop them to Extra Storage this week.</li>
<li>
<b>Sophomore Mariners</b> (Lloyd) - need to get from him</li>
</ul><br>Thanks to Rich for his help tonight.  I think the appetizers and beers he was serving influenced the turnout.

          I will make arrangements to turn in mine when I get back from vaca. My catchers equipment and helmet were not used and are still in plastic wrap.  We can save them for future or try to send back to SUperflash. I'm sure we can use them going forward.  <br>
