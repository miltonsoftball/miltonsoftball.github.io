          27 teams and 10 replies, overall response is coaches are thankful for all the new equipment. One suggestion is a batting stick per team. I will continue to monitor responses.

          Any way you can also send this to freshwomen coaches? One suggestion made<br>to me is pads to tell where to place feet. Amazing how 70% of the time a<br>player gets up to bat they need to be adjusted. One per box would be fine.<br><br>Also one set of coaches need lock box keys - Dana email me for their<br>address and/or I can grab from you to get to them. Thanks so much!

          All set, I just sent it.<br><br>I don't have any good reason why I didn't send an email to the Freshwoman coaches, sorry for the oversight!

          Overall feedback is positive, a few large helmets that I am giving fitkits to the coaches to try to fit better.Â
