          Dana and Rich...we also need to schedule a day for all the coaches to pickup equipment at the storage facility. This will depend on when the equipment will be delivered from SuperFlash (they will deliver to the storage facility).

          A few items you may want to consider now that we have boxes and coaches can use and leave in the box.  Hitting (pop up) nets, <a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.softball.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=71" target="_blank">http://www.softball.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=71</a>) realizing its more of a summer team item, all teams, practices, spring, etc would benefit.  Gile with tight space especially.  Hitting T's- probably most important and under used piece of equipment.  Most boxes did have one, it would be great to outfit each box with a new one, if need be.  This should be the Freshmans Coach # 1 tool.<br><br>Has been discussion in the past of hooks on the inside of the boxes, we could supply and hang a bag of Chin straps (think they come 6 to a pack).<br><br>Luxury training item- Hitting stick,<a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.sportsunlimitedinc.com/sklz-target-softball-bat-swing-trainer-fastpitch.html" target="_blank">http://www.sportsunlimitedinc.com/sklz-target-softball-bat-swing-trainer-fastpitch.html</a>, maybe one for each box.  <br><br>These are all items that help make practice more effective as you can break them up into groups as they have tools to use.
