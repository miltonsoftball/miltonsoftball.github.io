    The four equipment boxes now have bases, batting tees and first aid kits. The only question I have is do we buy 3 tape measures for the Gile, Cunningham and Kelly boxes? I don't think we need a tape at Andrews.

          Thanks Dana. I'll have you all know that I was the first recipient of the first aid kiit at Cunningham, as I foolishly sliced my hand against a tree reaching for a ball at practice tonight. Great timing on the kit!!!
