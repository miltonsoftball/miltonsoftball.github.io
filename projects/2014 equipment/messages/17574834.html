  <div class="content">
    Dana, Rich and Karen met on Sun., 10/27 and emptied the equipment boxes at Andrews, Cunningham and Kelly fields. All blue helmets were left in the Kelly box to donate. Damaged equipment was thrown out. All other equipment was brought to the Extra Storage location. <br><br>Gary...can you please find out if Parks and Rec has moved our equipment back to the box at Gile so that we can go through the equipment there in a few weeks? Please let Dana, Rich or me know when it is available for us, thank you!<br><br>We will be meeting again, Sat., 11/9 at 9am until approx. 1pm to empty all the bags, take inventory and create a list of equipment to replace. ANYONE and EVERYONE is welcome to come and help us, even if you can just volunteer an hour or so. It is going to be a dirty job so please don't wear anything you don't mind getting dusty and dirty.<br><br>Thank you to Shawn for helping us transport everything to Extra Storage!
