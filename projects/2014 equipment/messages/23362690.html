          Quick question.  Are you missing any equipment bags?  If so, are they with existing coaches and do you want them to bring them to Equipment Day on 3/29?<br><br>Are there any bags with coaches that are no longer coaching?

          Ok something that we didn't pay close attention to the other night. I just pulled my inventory sheet from 11/13  and it states 3 teams' bags were missing then. I do not know if we received them after. I have not updated the sheet.<br><ol>
<li>Jeniors Cubs--I don't know who the coach was last year.<br>Juniors Rangers--I don't know who the coach was last year.<br>We did have one bag that wasn't labeled so maybe one of these returned their bag and one didn't.</li>
<li>Seniors Rockies--This was Laurie Jensen's team.</li>
</ol>Dana, Brian and I can pull these division bags and look to see if we have them. If we don't Dana or I can contact them and ask them to bring it next Sat., 3/29 so we can take out the old equipment and give them new equipment.

          <b>Junior Cubs </b>- Rose/Carroll... Ted may be able to tell us if they still have a bag.<br><b>Junior Rangers</b> - We definitely have this bag.  It was Eric Kelly's and he had his own bag but I moved it all into another bag.  It is in the storage unit (hopefully labeled).<br><b>Senior Rockies</b> - I agree with Dana/Karen that we never received this.<br><br>Keep in mind we should have an extra bag for seniors since we dropped a team (Pirates) as well as 3 extra bags from Freshwomen (dropped 3 teams).

          Sounds good. We can do that or I could meet them somewhere if they are not coaching again this year.
