<div><br></div>
<div>My name is Rob Mosher and I am a board member of the Franklin Girls Softball Association and a coach of one of our 14U teams this season.  I wanted to let you know about a softball tournament we are hosting this season, that we think is kind of unique.  First a little background about Franklin Girls Softball Association.<br>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are fortunate in Franklin that softball is very popular, as a result we are able to field multiple teams at each age group (10U-18U), so we try to place teams in both the Hockomock and Twin Valley summer softball leagues when ever possible.  While we find that league play is generally balanced and competitive, it’s when we go out to find tournaments, that our second, third and fourth teams, in each age division, are generally overmatched.  Girls on those teams, end up not having as great of an experience as the girls on our top teams.  What we start to see happen around 14U, is that they begin to either drop out of the sport, or leave for a club team to try and play for a team that may be able to compete a bit better.  In those cases, what ends up happening is the player isn’t necessarily getting the playing time on the club team to grow and develop her skills and then they quit the sport.  By looking around at the different summer leagues, and the shear amount of teams in the B divisions that exist, we know we can’t be alone in this conundrum</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Here in Franklin, we’d like to help solve for this problem.  I have observed in other sports my children compete in, that there are tournaments that cater to town B teams (Basketball), and in other sports (Soccer and Lacrosse), they segment the tournaments so top teams are grouped together and the lower teams are grouped together and never the two shall meet.  We think that is one of the reasons that those sports are flourishing, because regardless of the skill level, players are getting competitive games which are far more enjoyable to participate it.  And lets face it, tournaments are fun and a great team bonding experience no matter what the sport.  They create memories that kids will remember forever.  We’d like to do the same thing for softball.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Franklin traditionally hosts a Memorial Day Tournament every year that has historically always been very well received by the local softball community.  Last year, because we upgraded our playing facilities, we opened it up to both 10U and 12U and had a record number of teams sign up and participate.  This year in addition to our Memorial Day Tournament, we are going to host a second tournament at the 14U level, and we are calling it the Killer B Tournament.  This will be an ASA sanctioned, invitational tournament and will specifically cater to 14U town B (and lower) teams.  I have attached the flyer so you can see the details.  We chose the weekend of June 17th for a couple of reasons:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>1) It is the same weekend as the 14U ASA State Tournament.  I had several long and in-depth conversations with the local ASA chapter about our vision for this tournament, and having this weekend be a “dead period” for all other tournaments seemed unfair for all the other town teams that would never enter into a state tournament.  I convinced them to allow this specific format catering to this much larger pool of players and they agreed to open it up to us.  There really shouldn’t be another 14U ASA tournament taking place in Massachusetts this weekend, so it eliminates any softball conflicts.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>2)  It is generally the beginning of the summer season for most of the leagues in the state.  We thought this would be a good opportunity for the town B (and lower) teams to get together before the season starts, or gets into full swing, to see what they would need to work on during the season and find out where there gaps might be.  But more importantly, build a little team chemistry that teams can build off of for the season.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The tournament is listed on the ASA website (<a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.asanewengland.com/TournamentDetails.aspx?TournamentKey=3136" target="_blank">http://www.asanewengland.com/TournamentDetails.aspx?TournamentKey=3136</a> &lt;<a data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.asanewengland.com/TournamentDetails.aspx?TournamentKey=3136&gt;" target="_blank">http://www.asanewengland.com/TournamentDetails.aspx?TournamentKey=3136&gt;</a>) and teams can go there and register.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have attached a flyer with more details.  If you are not the correct person to receive this information and are no longer affiliated with your towns softball program, I’d ask that you forward it on to the appropriate individual within your league, thank you!! </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have reached out to teams from the four major summer softball leagues in the state (Middle Essex, Twin Valley, Hockomock, and South Shore) with the hopes we could get a few teams from each league, making it a little more diverse.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We would forever be grateful for your support and look forward to seeing you this summer!</div>
