    <b>Over 90 girls attended tryouts on Saturday. Record number for our program. Congrats!!</b><br><br>We have some key decisions to make on teams by each U-Level. Let's start by looking at the numbers:<br>U18 - <b>TOTAL: 11+:</b> 11 committed to playing. Few others in the mix.<br>U14 - <b>TOTAL 28:</b> 26 at tryouts, 2 were away. Of the 28, 3 are U12s asking to play up on U14 <br>U12 - <b>TOTAL 38: </b>32 at tryouts, 5 were away, 1 was a no show and did not let league know she could not make it.*  Of the 38, 3 are U10s asking to play up on U12<br>U10 - <b>TOTAL 36: </b>25 at tryouts, 5 were away/injured, 6 were a no show and did not let league know she could not make it.* <br><br>Teams:<br><b>U18</b><br><ul><li>1 team</li></ul><b><br>U14</b><br><ul>
<li>2 teams (how many per team? 12 or 13?)</li>
<li>Are we cutting girls?</li>
<li>Do the U12 girls get pushed to their age appropriate division?</li>
</ul><br><b>U12:</b><br><ul>
<li>3 teams? </li>
<li>Do we have 1 Elite and 2 balanced teams? OR 3 in same division (if allowed)? How many per team? 11, 12 or 13? </li>
<li>Are we cutting girls?  </li>
<li>Do the U12 girls get pushed to their age appropriate division?</li>
</ul><b><br>U10</b><br><ul>
<li>2 teams? 3 teams? </li>
<li>Do we have 1 Elite and 2 balanced teams? OR 3 in same division (if allowed)? Or 2 teams and the 3rd is a more formalized Summer Slam that Sally did last summer with practices and scrimmages with other U10s and possible scrimmages with the towns?</li>
<li>Hate to cut girls (especially when the number gets to 8 or more. We may lose them for good). </li>
<li>How many per team? 11, 12 or 13? Are we cutting girls?  </li>
</ul><br><b>A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. LET THE CONVERSATION BEGIN. </b><br><br><b>PLEASE WEIGH IN AS WE ARE TARGETING FRIDAY TO HAVE THIS DEFINED. </b><br><br><br><b>*NOTE:</b><br><i>I have a POV that if a player does not show up for tryouts and does not inform the program before tryouts that she is unable to attend, MGS do not have an obligation to hold a spot for her. I consider her a NSNE (No Show, No Excuse). We can offer her a spot if we need the numbers, but in my opinion we are not obligated. I would love to hear your thoughts about this.</i>

          <br>I agree with your POV.  If going the Elite team route I think it is important to have the best team possible at each elite level. Three girls from U10 and U12 playing above their age groups would probably prevent their age appropriate elite teams from being successful. I am assuming they are top players.  My experience with this is that while not dramatically helping the higher age group team it has a huge effect on the lower age level team. This is one of the reasons we had some bad experiences in the Hock league. Only reason should be to fill out rosters or a coaches daughter situation.

          I'm new to all these roster dynamics, so I expect others have more experience;  <br><br>-I do agree with a soft NSNE  policy.  <br><br>-It seems there are smaller % of stand-out skill players overall.  Most are about in the middle I would say.  <br><br>-If three teams would be allowed, I think it would be best for us keep more kids playing in some way.    In that case  ...I would lean toward one elite team based on the try out results.    Split the talent up between the two others even if that creates two so-so rosters.   The summer league last season I saw was not at all over the heads of our mediocre kids.  They tried out for a competitive spot.  Challenging them should be fine if we are allowed.   I suppose if we had to have one competitive scrimmage league team then I'd still do that, but try to make it somehow an equal (even if different) experience to the other "B" team.  <br><br>-Maybe the playing up decision should stay just a case by case basis, depending more on the logistics of roster needs in the overall picture, and of course safety.    I think kids should be pushed to work over their heads, as long as they are at the same time coached to handle the experience (and there always exists a possibility for even small successes).   Working "just above" perceived or actual is a fundamental standard.   However, often the most skilled, by the very nature of their exceptional abilities, undervalue the important lessons of leadership and "Team".  Sometimes that is just because its harder to coach those things.   How many girls are there really who wouldn't be learning something in either situation? Parents want what is best for their kids.  If there is merit in that explanation to all and ultimately in their daughters experience, then in the end you won't have gone wrong.

          Here are some of my thoughts to my feedback.  Retention and growth versus competition and skill?  <br><br>- Only 1 u10 team 2 years ago, lack of interest/participation of skilled players<br>- Significant interest re-bound this year, numbers support 3 teams at U12<br>- Do skill evaluations support 3 SSSSL teams?  If so, I believe the program would benefit long term, as would the spring rec league.<br><br><b>South Shore Summer League </b>- the non-Elite division is definitely steps down from the Hockomock;<br><br>- pitching is nowhere near as strong, depth of teams not as deep<br>- allows the younger teams to play and be competitive<br>- good to have 2/3 of team capable of solid IF play<br><br><b>Rosters &amp; Depth<br></b>As a coach, and the players got better/older (2nd year U10...U12 would expect it to happen more)...3 players on the bench where you are still a lot of "5 inning time limit games" left girls with average 4 innings.<br><br>U10 - 12 (13 max)<br>U12 - 11 (12 max)<br>U14 - 11 ...my guess?<br><br><b>Summer Commitment<br></b>One thing we don't know 100% is the commitment mindset of the players and families.  Such as, are there a number of players who are going to miss 1 or more of 4 weeks?<br><br><b>MAB Reference (discussion for next season.....)</b><br>Kevin had noted he had discussions about other examples of summer programs, notably with MAB.  First hand experience, the families had options of 1 of 3 approach's for tryout's;<br><br>1) Register for A (Elite?) team, with commitment of 3-4 tournaments and practices/games 4 days a week or <br>2) Register for A or B (accept whatever placement the player achieves)<br>2) Register for B only (larger rosters, less commitment and 1 tournament)<br><br><b>MGS Approach</b> - on summer tryouts, indicate if trying out for South Shore travel league only, or the travel league + Elite/Tournament Team (note the expectations, # of practices, tournaments etc.)<br><br><b>PROPOSAL<br></b>1) Field as many summer travel teams as possible (U10, U12) for regular week-day season.  <br>2) Balance teams, believe our skill level will be fine in upper third of the South Shore league versus the Hockomock league<br>2) Single U10/12 Elite or "Tournament Team" based on tryouts, play in 3-4 tournaments from Memorial Day through July, satisfies level of play/interest<br><br><b>Benefits</b><br>- Expose more girls to summer play, enhance their game awareness and experience.<br>- Spring rec league play increases in its level of competition<br>- Summer team experiences the camaraderie and enjoyment of the game<br><br>Lloyd

          Summer Teams<br><br>I think we are all set with the U18's.<br><br>For the U14 teams they should have no more than 12 to 13 players. You have to take into consideration that all players might not make every game due to events and god forbid, injuries.<br>I'm not sure what to do with the players that want to play up. I know they are good and should be playing at a higher level to keep their interest as well. I also know of one player that is not playing spring but has been in the league before.<br><br>The U12's. I think we should make one elite team and then balance out the other two.<br><br>The U10's. We should try and keep these girls playing to retain their interest for next year. Make as many teams that we can without having a lot sit on the bench.<br><br>The only other question is do we have enough coaches for all these teams?
