    Does anyone have a contact at Curry or Milton Academy?<br><br>I figure we should try to book some extra field time if possible. The dates would be Monday thru Thursday from 6/22 through 7/28. Â If so, could you reach out and ask for any softball field time?<br><br>Someone (Lloyd?) mentioned a permit request for Houghton's. Do we request a couple of nights?<br><br>We will also plan to have some night games as well at Gile.

          Called DCR today, very interesting what I have learned.....<br>Town of Milton - has  permits for ALL fields (baseball, soccer, etc.)From April -&gt; November (automatically renew, first right of refusal)3:30pm -&gt; 7:30pm weekday's and all day Saturday<br>They direct any Town of Milton requests to Dave Perdios for schedule requests.  She did not know the configuration of what fields by type (softball etc.) but gave me a number for the DCR Supervisor Kevin Drake (617)-472-9325 whom I left a message for without visual knowledge of the fields.

          Thanks Lloyd for research. I've been in contact with Dave Perdios and we are in process of requesting available fields for both MA and Curry.
