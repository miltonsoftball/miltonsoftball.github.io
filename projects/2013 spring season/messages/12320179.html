    With the rain today, we are in a tight spot with regards to fields.  Tomorrow is a critical day for us  The forecast calls for rain with the sun breaking out early/mid afternoon.  So ... here comes my request:<br><br>If anyone is available in the late afternoon to help prep the fields for Tuesday's games, we would LOVE your help.  We have games at Kelly, Gile and Andrews (Cunningham is unavailable due to the road race). <br><br>Ideally we would have at least 2 people at each field.  If you are available to help out, please post your response below.  <br><br>Thanks!

          I am around and can help at Kelly, Gile or both,  just let me know. <br><br>Not to throw another monkey wrench into Saturday's plans, but there is a huge private party that is happening from 6:30pm-10pm for a girl that is leaving Pierce to go off to boarding school. She has invited almost the whole seventh grade to this party, and which ever 2 teams make it to the senior championship game they could potentially not have enough girls to play the game. <br><br>So if we do not have to push the games to Sunday, which I know is still the hope. I was wondering what everyone thinks about playing the senior game at 2:00, the sophomore at 4:30, and let the juniors play under the lights at 7:00?

          Just went by Gile. The field seems to be absorbing a very small amount of the puddles. Still very obvious and a lot of puddles where there were never any puddles before. The dugouts are now flooded where they must have pitched some of the water. Still a very messy situation.

          I went down to Gile this afternoon, and the dirt is extremely wet and muddy, with more rain expected today, does anyone have an idea of how long it will take to total dry out? <br><br>Kenny, since this is what you do, any guess?<br><br>I wonder if the park department should put temporary fencing around it till it dries? if kids or dogs go on this before it dries it will be a mess!<br><br>Kevin, Gary and Karen, I know your heads are probably spinning, trying to figure out how to get all the rained out games played. But with more rain in the forecast for the end of the week, not sure how it will work without moving the championship games to Sunday and use Saturday to get all games played. 
<p><br></p>
<p>I know it is Father's Day on Sunday and you do not want to mess up family's plans. But in my opinion, if you let people know now that they could potentially be playing on Sunday, they can plan the rest of their day around that chance. Instead of finding out Thursday or Friday when making or changing plans is more difficult. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am sure that you are already discussing this possibility and just wanted to throw in my view as a board member, coach and parent. Thanks!</p>

          Thanks for the ideas.<br><br>We are exploring several options including<br><ul>
<li>starting a few games at 4/4:30 so we can double up</li>
<li>Teams playing multiple games on Saturday (i.e. 9am and 4:30pm)</li>
<li>Moving games/division championship(s) to Sunday</li>
<li>Using additional Milton fields (Curry, MCL, Milton Academy</li>
</ul><br>We are also working within the guideline that Seniors will not have games on Friday due to the school social.<br><br>With each rainy day the options become less and less. We are creating multiple "what if scenarios" including one that has Gile unavailable for the entire playoffs.  We are open to other ideas.   Keep the ideas coming.

          Tonight's rain is making the situation at Gile worse. It will need a couple of days of dry &amp; sunny weather to tighten up in order to make it playable. The town also has to groom it once it tightens up to address the hollows/puddled areas. The other thing that was noticed last night when Josh and I looked at the field is the fact that either the mound or home plate is off center by a noticeable bit. One or the other is not lined up properly. I know the mound was taken out when the field was under construction. I assume(????) the plate was also taken out and put back in. Again I believe it was a race to get finished and not done carefully. I hate to throw daggers but these were supposedly professional contractors doing this job. It seems corners were cut. In any event the jury is out on the rest of the week at Gile. Miracles do happen though???

          Maybe Miracles do happen, here is what Gile and Kelly look like this morning! <br><br>Still not sure that Gile will be dry enough to play on tonight, but it looks great after the amount of rain we got last night. Especially, when I went by there last night around 7:00 and the infield and the outfield were completely flooded!<br><br>Kelly is definitely workable, I am around this afternoon to help if needed. <br><br>Hopefully the park dept. will not close the fields again!

          <br>I just went by all three fields. <br><br>Kelly is in pretty good shape may need some raking around the pitcher's mound and possibility some quick dry along first and third base lines, but the sun may take care of this for us. Can probably be handled by Brian and Ted.<br><br>Andrews is puddle free, it does have a small trench down the middle of the field and towards right field, from the running water, so this would need some raking. Along left field before the grass could use some quick dry, again the sun may take care of this for us.<br><br>Gile is definitely soft, with some spots that you just sink into the dirt. Not sure what the effects of 24 girls in cleats will have on the field?? <br>There are still a few really wet areas, not sure if the sun will have this all dried out before game time, but here's hoping it does!<br><br>Does anyone know if there is quick dry at Andrews? I didn't think to check the box until after I left there! Is there any at Kelly? I can grab some from there, if needed. I can go by this afternoon and rake the areas that need it, if anyone else can make it let me know what time works and I can meet you there.<br><br>There should be no problems playing at Kelly and Andrews, and fingers crossed for Gile, but doesn't look great, at this hour!

          I am going to pick up Caroline at the high school at 2:30. I will let you know how soft the field is. Laurie if you said it was soft then that goes along with what I have said all along. Not a good idea to use this field. But according to Kevin the burden has been taken off the league's shoulders until something happens.

          Hi there - I wanted to give everyone a brief update.  As you know this week as been crazy in terms of the weather.  Games are getting PPD and push back.  We had to push back some 2nd round games so the first round could play.  <br><br>We have come up with no less than 5 scenarios to get the playoffs complete.  Karen and I are reviewing them again this morning and we will communicate the plan as soon as possible.  <br><br>We want to balance the constant rescheduling of games VS. skipping a day or two because we assume the fields will not be playable.  Hang tight.

          Laurie, I am sorry for the delay but I wanted to respond to your earlier post  and email about moving the championship game times.<br><br>As you know, the weather and field conditions has caused havoc with the playoff schedule.  After taking into consideration field availability, the weather forecast, father's day, and the 8th grade school function the scenario we released today was the best one possible.<br><div><br></div><div>With the weather expected today and Friday, we decided to hold off playing any games until 12pm on Saturday - assuming the games today are postponed.  This will hopefully allow the fields to dry out. As a result, we need to play 13 games over Saturday and Sunday on 3 fields.  The 2pm time slot is not available - we have a first round Senior game and two junior semis. </div><div><br></div><div>Unless the weather affects the schedule, we are very comfortable with where we netted out considering all the variables mentioned above.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, your original request to shift the championship games took me off-guard.  We do our best to accommodate for school related events.  The championship games were scheduled and set in February.  As a policy we do not change pre-scheduled events for a private party/event including 1st Communions, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>The way I see it, you were asking 6 teams to change their plans.  This equates to approximately 75 girls.  You requested this change to accommodate approximately 10 kids (assuming each team has 5 7th graders and that all were invited (BTW, I don't know a lot of 7th graders but I do know of 5 that were not invited).  I do not think it's fair to ask  the league to change games times to accommodate 10 girls when it could impact 75.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope you understand and will support our decision.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin</div>

          Hi Kevin, Please let me start by stating I know how horrible this week must be for you Karen and Gary trying to figure all of this out. <br><br>I am not asking this of you because it will only impact my team. I have already heard from Meg Toyais and Brian Conroy about the possibility of not being able to field a team. <br><br>I just went through all the team rosters of the 5 teams that could or will be impacted by this game time and of the 58 players on the A's, Phillies, Pirates, Rays and Rockies at least 23 have been invited to this party. <br><br>I know that you do not want to make exceptions for private/family events, and I understand this. We are not looking to move it to a different day just earlier in the day. If we cannot flip-flop with the junior game at 2:00, can we play at 12 at Cunningham, and the Pirates game could be played at 2:00 at Kelly as there is no game at that time.<br><br>I just feel that it would be horrible for any of these teams to be faced with forfeiting a playoff game when there is a fairly simple solution. I hope you understand where Meg, Brian and I are coming from. And Mark and Josh will probably feel the same way once they play their game and one of them has to field a team Saturday as well.

          It's not that easy.  The senior game has been canceled for today.  This game is now at 2pm on Saturday.    The winner of this game needs to play AGAIN on Saturday.  Here is the grid of what we need to accomplish.  Keep in mind.  No games before 12 and Gile is unavailable.  See attached.

          Let me start off by saying months ago when the spring schedule came out everyone knew when the championship games were going to take place. All teams should have been committed to accomplishing the goal of reaching the playoffs and possibly the championship game, including coaches, parents, and ultimately the players involved. Now I understand certain things come up now and then when a player cannot make a game. My own daughter missed several games due to surgery that was not planned when the season started and who has done everything possible to get back into action and help out her team. But it's the playoffs and championship games we are talking about. I realize the weather has not cooperated this week but sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Ones that not everyone agrees with. Like it or not it's about the entire team. Not just the ones who have decided they rather go to another event. What about the players who were not invited. Should they be excluded from playing in the playoffs if you choose to forfeit the game. After all it's about the entire team. It's not fair for everyone involved but it just happened that this girl is having a party at the same time as some of our games. Should we cancel everything because of this party??? I think not. My suggestion....play in the game and be a little late for the party. It's not just about you. Your decision affects the whole team. It's about commitment. A commitment that was made when you signed up to play spring softball. I applaud Kevin for everything he has done to try and get this week and the playoffs going. It's an major undertaking and certainly the weather basically messed us up along with the town's Park Department. Unfortunately he cannot accomodate every other outside activity too. We are under the gun to get this done by Sunday (not by choice) and then Monday the start of summer travel. We all will have to deal with it equally. I believe the coaches should try and explain this to their teams and the parents that this could not be helped. But like I wrote when I started; we all knew our league's spring schedule including playoffs and championship games back in March and April when we started the season.

          Kenny, Just so you know my daughter's will be at the game at 6:00 on Saturday! And they will be going to the party late!<br><br>I, as a coach, can only ask and hope that the parents of my other players will make the same decision as I have. I agree with your statement of the commitment to the team, and yes sometimes life sucks and we don't get to do what we hope to. <br><br>But that being said, if it could have been accommodated by the league, that was going to have to rearrange everyone's schedules anyways, because of the weather, was I so wrong to ask? <br><br>What the girls on my and Brian's teams do, which is out of our control, will determine what happens in the semi-finals of the playoffs. And should the A's win their first game Saturday, you could be facing the same dilemma!<br><br>So I was not speaking for only my girls and my team but for ultimately all 4 teams that will be playing at 6 on Saturday! I resent the implication that you seem to believe that this is all about me and my daughters. I am just looking for the best situation for all of these girls, and as I have stated previously, how sad would it be if a team has to forfeit a playoff game, when there were other options!

          I agree. I don't understand why the girls can't play a game and then go to a party that lasts until 10pm. I'm assuming that many of these girls have played in our program for years and understand the significance and responsibility of playoff softball.

          For the record I never mentioned you or your daughter's and I am taken back that you think so!!! We all know how much you and your daughter's love softball. It' about all of the girls involved and that's when the coaches have to explain to the team what the outcome might be if they have to forfeit the games. However you have been, through basecamp suggesting to move the championship game for the past week even though a schedule was prepared for the season back in March and April. Agreeing to attend a party knowing full well that the playoffs were already scheduled is not a well thought out decision. Unfortunately the weather has not cooperated and Kevin has been doing the best that he can to make up games and reschedule the schedule multiple times. I am happy your girls are going to play. After all it's the right thing to do. I am sure if the A's happen to get to that position the coach will explain what the implications would be by forfeiting. All that I can say is hopefully we will have enough girls to play the games and go to the party afterwards.

          I am going to respectfully ask that everyone not post anymore on this subject unless it is constructive. This is a very difficult situation and trust me when I say that Kevin and I have spent many hours this week on the phone and email, sending files back and forth with different options trying to figure out how to take everything into consideration and make everyone happy. Mother Nature keeps messing around with us and forcing us to cancel games and the situation at Gile is also presenting us with another challenge because we cannot play on that field. Gary is out of the country celebrating his anniversary and he is emailing us daily trying to support us. We are getting emails from coaches and parents and they are not pleasant. <br><br>I am asking this BOD to keep it together and be professional...Please. We do not have to agree with each other but we do need to keep the conversation above board and be respectful with each other.

          I totally respect and appreciate the effort that went into this from the Exec board. With full time jobs and other responsibilities, it is an enormous task to deal with the hand in scheduling that was dealt to them this week. MLB couldn't devise a schedule that was going to satisfy everybody, and if parents or coaches not on the board have issues, then they should join us next year to become part of the solution.

          Just a field update....Kelly multiple puddles everywhere and very soft. Andrew's draining with streams going from the backstop to the outfield. Might take a period of time to drain as  the water is coming from the hill and houses behind the field. Cunningham very soft and ugly. Will need a lot of time to dry out. Mary C. Lane soft and lots of puddles. And of course Gile no fish ...forget about it for a couple of days. But we already knew that. Will check later as the day goes. Sun is trying to come out but we have a long way to go.
