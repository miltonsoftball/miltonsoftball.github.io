          Here is the thread on Rules that we recommended back at beginning of season. <br><br>Sent from my iPhone<br><br>On Mar 23, 2013, at 10:09 AM, <a data-behavior="truncate" href="mailto:bv51@comcast.net" target="_blank">bv51@comcast.net</a> wrote:<br><br>I already heard a complaint on the new rule from a sophomore coach, whose opinion was that taking a girl out after 5 walks would be damaging to her confidence. I explained that keeping girls in the field for an additional 2 potential walks and not giving as many girls as possible the opportunity to swing at strikes would be more detrimental to an already long game. Idea of this exercise was to speed up the game and try to get more than 4 innings. <br><br>Sent from my iPhone<br><br>On Mar 23, 2013, at 9:53 AM, <a data-behavior="truncate" href="mailto:kenjohnson77@comcast.net" target="_blank">kenjohnson77@comcast.net</a> wrote:<br><br>That sounds good to me. I agree that the pitching should be better at that point.

I would recommend that the 5 walk rule doesn't apply in the playoffs, only the 4 run rule. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from my iPhone<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Mar 22, 2013, at 6:06 PM, Kevin Olivieri  wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I had another question on the Sophomore rules.  We have indicated that a pitcher would come out after 5 walks.  What happens in the playoffs?  Does she still come out?  If so, who pitches since coaches don't pitch?  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Mar 15, 2013, at 8:08 PM, Bill Vaughn  wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi guys, we just met and discussed some rules proposals that we recommend  before next weeks meetings begin:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sophomore pitching: we are recommending that during the regular season, there is a 5 walk maximum per inning per pitcher. After the fifth walk, the opposing coach would come in to finish the inning pitching to his or her own team. The girl who has been taken out is still allowed to re-enter the game in any subsequent inning. As we discussed, coaches at no point are allowed to walk their own players, and will also continue to pitch the first 2 innings of every game. However, we are recommending that for the playoffs, coaches will not  relieve a girl after 5 walks in an inning, and  also would not pitch the first two innings either. So, no coaches pitching in the playoffs. The rational behind this is that by June, pitching skills should improve and rotations tightened to the point where the girls should control  their own destiny on the mound. Also, many of the girls who pitch will be playing more competitive summer ball a week later, and preparing them for better competition would prove beneficial to both them and the program.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We also propose as a recommendation, not a rule,  that for all divisions, the league provide lightweight pitching cages/masks that would be available for all pitchers to use. We suggest buying one per team, and making it part of the equipment bag. We should announce it to all parents that this is available. The thinking here is that for  relatively short money, maybe $300-$500, we would provide a safety mechanism, which if it saves one nose or set of teeth, would be well worth it. Optional, but available.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We propose clarifying and enforcing  the rule that for all divisions, outfielders need to be on the outfield grass, not on the dirt and outfield border. This came up in playoff games in both sophomore and junior divisions...funny only in playoff games.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, we want to clarify and recommend the suggestion at the board meeting that for the sophomore division, only 6 girls are required to start the game, with 8 finishing.  What was not discussed amongst the rules committee, but just popped into my head while typing, is how to we treat the game where 6 start, and less than 8 finish, despite expectations of late arrivals, My suggestion is that the coaches decide at home plate amongst themselves before the game as to whether or not the game will be official should the 7th and/or 8th girl not show up. My prediction is that in every instance, the coaches agree to play the game and let the results stand, which at this level, serves everybody's best interest.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ...I really should have paid attention and practiced during the  4 week typing class in 8th grade,.. because i"m still 2 finger Charlie and terrible at it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill<br>&gt;&gt;
