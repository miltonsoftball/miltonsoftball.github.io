    We have been contacted by Steve Kelley (family friend of Gary's) about buying group tickets for a Red Sox game.  I am sharing this with the board and if anyone has an interest in exploring the idea of a league night, coaches night or a Board of Directors night, feel free to reach out to Steve.<br><br>I would ask that if you are interested in learning more and/or organizing an event, please reply on Basecamp so we do not have multiple board members contacting him. <br><br>His email is below.  Thanks!<br>--------<br><br><p><i>On Thu, Apr 11, 2013 at 12:56 PM, Kelley, Stephen &lt;</i><a><i>skelley@redsox.com</i></a><i>&gt; wrote:</i></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Hi Gary,</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>We are running a friendly front office sales contest at Fenway to fire up the troops.  Building off the success of Futures at Fenway in 2012, I am asking for your help as my team is determined to win!</i></p><p><i>Would you consider a group outing (20 tickets or more to a specific game) at Fenway this season, or a group purchase of tickets for a charity of your choice?  This will be painless --- all you have to do is let me know if you are interested and I will follow up with you or someone in your office to work out the details.  As an FYI, my team gets double credit for April outings, so please keep that in mind!  Please support us by purchasing a fun, inexpensive outing at the ballpark for your company, your family, or the charity of your choice.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Thanks for your loyal support of the Red Sox and Fenway Park!</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Steve Kelley</i><br><i>
