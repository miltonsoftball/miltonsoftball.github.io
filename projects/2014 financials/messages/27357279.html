    <p>I'm going to email the Board and ask for any receipts and/or outstanding invoices this week. Bill, you have 1 or 2 checks still? If you need them that's fine but please confirm the #s you have. Kevin, let me know what your reimbursement amount for the check I gave you. </p><p><br></p><p>Anything else? It will take me a while to catch up but I'd like to do it all in one sitting but to do that I need all info. Thanks!<br></p>

          Calece, I still have checks 1109-1111. I will hold on to them as I will need to send one to DD for summer team clinics and will let you know once all teams have participated. Also, I had a girl on my Giants team that quit early on after a couple practices and maybe 1 game. Can you send a registration reimbursement for $85 (guess of registration minus uniform) to Maria Alvarado (daughter Isabel) to 48 Ashville Road, Hyde Park Ma. 02136.  Thanks.

          I would suggest a couple things:<br><ul>
<li>Whomever sends the check, we should include a note as to why it is $85 vs. $105.Â </li>
<li>Do you know if Maria lives in Hyde Park vs. Milton? I thought she was in Milton and the father was in Hyde Park.</li>
<li>We should confirm from registration who wrote the check.</li>
</ul>
