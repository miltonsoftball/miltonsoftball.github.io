          Hi Kevin, I just wanted to let you know that Shawn Ward was my assistant last year and he was planning on keeping the sophmore team with his younger daughter that was on the team last year. His older daughter will be moving up with me to the junior division. Let me know if you need any help.<br>Thanks<br>Dana

          Dana - could we look into some type of permanent label sticker (or even an ID#) to identify our equipment and helmets as "property of Milton Girls Softball?

          Dana-<br>Attached is a record of all the new helmets given to the freshwomen and sophomore divisions and the catching equipment given to the Juniors.  All items were tagged with a "property of Milton Girls Softball" tag and ID #/barcode.  The attached document as all the barcode numbers for each equipment item.<br><br>The second tab in the document was a checklist I used when handing out equipment and uniforms.  We can use it in futures years as well.
