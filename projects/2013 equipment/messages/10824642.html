    <h2>Field Drying Material</h1>

  <div class="content">
    Just as an F.Y.I.; I picked up the field drying material needed for Kelly and Gile. They have both been dropped off at those field and in the boxes. This is the drying agent that we use on the fields in Quincy and it works if used the right way. This is an expensive product. Not as much is needed as regular speedy-dry. This is the real stuff. This is not going to work in flooded/puddled areas. Only will work in soft/muddy areas. The flooded/puddled areas have to be bailed out and scratched out as much as possible. Let air dry a bit to get a little stiff and then add this material as needed working it into soil. Leave the soil loose/scratched and between the material and air will dry more quickly. There are also steel rakes and brooms in both boxes. Good Luck!! If you have any questions call me.
