  <div class="content">
    As part of the surplus initiative, helmets for the Freshwomen and the Sophomore Divisions have been priced and approved  The Sophomore order has been placed.  The Freshwomen order will be placed after we receive a sample size from Superflash to confirm the size is appropriate for this age level.  The sample helmet should be available for us by 3/21.<br><br>We also ordered 15 helmets for the girls who paid for them during registration.<br><br>Finally, we ordered decals for the helmets.  The helmet style and the decal are attached for your enjoyment.

          The helmets for the Sophomore Division are here!  They are in my garage.  <br><br>I also have the helmets that were ordered by girls during registration.<br><br>SuperFlash dropped off a sample for the Freshwomen Division and he wants us to test it on a few K-2 girls to make sure it fits.  Once we give him feedback, we will order them.  <b>Can any Freshwomen parents be testers of the new helmets?  Maybe stop over my house for 5 minutes and have her try it on?  Thanks!</b><br><br>We also have the "M" decals for the helmets.  Looks good.

          I'm going to Superflash later this week. Do we need anything else? I can pick up and give them a check if so.

          We (Junior Giants) need some chin straps and would like to swap out our catcher shin pads for a smaller size if possible?

          Thanks for the offer but I think we are all set with SuperFlash at the moment.  Karen drives by there almost daily so she has been awesome picking stuff up.<br><br>Also, we have additional chin straps.  Dana has them. Dana also has some extra catching equipment (from the upgrades we did).  I am sure you can find something in the box I gave him.
